00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,080
 Welcome to Ditto Insurance. My name is Kavya and today we will be talking about Carejoy,

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:08,320
 which is one of the most famous maternity plans out there.

3
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:11,480
 First, we will look at who should consider this policy.

4
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:15,840
 This plan is well suited for newly married couples who might need maternity,

5
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:21,580
 people who need newborn coverage and people who need security against birth defects.

6
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:25,180
 So, how good is Care compared to other players in the market?

7
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:28,960
 First, let's look at the 3-year claim settlement ratio.

8
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:34,600
 Now CARE is at 91% which compared to other players in the market is pretty decent.

9
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:38,500
 Next, we have the 3 year average incurred claim ratio.

10
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:47,040
 For CARE, it stands at 58% which is pretty good considering that we look at 55% to 75% as a good score.

11
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:50,340
 Next up is network hospitals and centres.

12
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:58,000
 So CARE has a network hospitals of 9400 which is pretty decent given other contemporaries are also in the same range.

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,500
 Lastly, we have 3 year average volume of complaints.

14
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:05,280
 Now this is where Care gets a little troubled.

15
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:11,240
 Because in 10,000 claims, Care gets at least 31 complaints which is comparatively a higher

16
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:13,780
 number if you look at HDFC.

17
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:16,460
 Next we will look at variants and other key differences.

18
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:20,760
 So Carejoy has two variants, Joy Today and Joy Tomorrow.

19
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:26,440
 In terms of features, the maternity coverage for a 3 lakh Joy Today and 3 lakh Joy Tomorrow

20
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:33,560
 is the same i.e. 35000 and for a 5 lakh variant it is 50000 in both the cases. Even the newborn

21
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:39,240
 cover is same for both the variants i.e. for a 3 lakh variant it is 30k whereas a 5 lakh

22
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:44,840
 variant has 50k cover. Now we are gonna talk about the differences. Maternity waiting periods

23
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:51,400
 for joy today is 9 months whereas joy tomorrow is 24 months i.e. you have to wait for these

24
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:57,080
 many months before you make a maternity related claim. And lastly the newborn defect cover for

25
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:04,680
 which Joy today has no cover but Joy tomorrow has a cover of 50k. Next up is eligibility criteria.

26
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:11,080
 Now the policy document says that 18 to 65 years ke bishme koi bhi ye plan le sakta hai but when

27
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:16,980
 you go on their website to buy the plan the limit is up to 45 years and for a child it is from day

28
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:31,483
 to 24 years of age Coming to the PED restrictions only benign conditions like high BP hypothyroid hernia only these are accepted The features we are gonna talk about right now are already covered in detail in this

29
00:02:31,483 --> 00:02:32,483
 video.

30
00:02:32,483 --> 00:02:35,803
 So to learn more you can tap that video and check them out.

31
00:02:35,803 --> 00:02:38,643
 Oh if you are new here, here's a little about Ditto.

32
00:02:38,643 --> 00:02:44,243
 We are an insurance advisory platform built by FinShots, India's favourite new age newsletter.

33
00:02:44,243 --> 00:02:49,723
 We provide honest or spam-free insurance advice about health and term insurance.

34
00:02:50,163 --> 00:02:52,143
 First of all, we will never push you to buy.

35
00:02:52,383 --> 00:02:53,643
 You can take as much time as you want.

36
00:02:54,463 --> 00:02:56,623
 And if you do choose to buy from us,

37
00:02:56,883 --> 00:03:01,323
 we will guide you through the entire journey as well as the claim settlement process.

38
00:03:01,523 --> 00:03:06,923
 This way, you can sit back, take your time to weigh your options and buy when you want to buy.

39
00:03:07,283 --> 00:03:09,783
 We are available on calls as well as WhatsApp.

40
00:03:10,083 --> 00:03:12,023
 So, talk to us at the link in description.

41
00:03:12,023 --> 00:03:15,023
 Let's look at the basic policy features.

42
00:03:15,023 --> 00:03:16,023
 Room rent restriction.

43
00:03:16,023 --> 00:03:27,023
 Now this policy has a room rent restriction of single private AC room which is pretty decent but in general we recommend a plan which does not have a room rent restriction at all.

44
00:03:27,023 --> 00:03:28,023
 Co-payment.

45
00:03:28,023 --> 00:03:39,023
 So if you enter the plan after 61 years you might have to take a 20% co-pay clause but like we said there is a mismatch between what the policy document says and what you can buy.

46
00:03:39,023 --> 00:03:40,023
 So check that out.

47
00:03:40,023 --> 00:03:46,223
 check that out. Coming to disease-wise sub-limits, thankfully there are none. And it covers 30 days

48
00:03:46,223 --> 00:03:52,343
 of pre-hospitalization expenses and 60 days of post-hospitalization expenses. Even the day care

49
00:03:52,343 --> 00:03:58,143
 treatments are covered up to the sum assured. However, domiciliary expenses, IUs treatments

50
00:03:58,143 --> 00:04:04,903
 and free annual health checkup are not covered. In fact, this plan does not even have a restoration

51
00:04:04,903 --> 00:04:12,123
 benefit. What is restoration benefit? For example, you have a plan of 10 lakhs and you use 2 lakhs

52
00:04:12,123 --> 00:04:18,463
 to make a claim. Now, some plans might give you a restoration of 2 lakhs back into your cover.

53
00:04:18,463 --> 00:04:24,443
 So again, you have a 10 lakh rupee cover for that year. This whole thing is called restoration

54
00:04:24,443 --> 00:04:30,543
 benefit. However, Care Health Insurance mentions on their website that there's a restoration benefit

55
00:04:30,543 --> 00:04:32,543
 but the plan does not really offer one.

56
00:04:32,543 --> 00:04:34,543
 Waiting Periods

57
00:04:34,543 --> 00:04:37,543
 This plan has an initial waiting period of 30 days

58
00:04:37,543 --> 00:04:39,543
 which is standard.

59
00:04:39,543 --> 00:04:54,546
 The PED waiting period is 4 years which is slightly high comparatively This plan also has a 2 year waiting period for specific illnesses and as we discussed there is a nine waiting period for care joy today

60
00:04:54,546 --> 00:05:01,086
 for on maternity and same 24 months for care joy tomorrow. Here is a complete list of their

61
00:05:01,086 --> 00:05:06,246
 specific illnesses under the plan. So for these issues you will have to wait for two years before

62
00:05:06,246 --> 00:05:13,146
 you make a claim. Now let's get into the standout features. Maternity coverage. This plan will give

63
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:20,086
 you pre and postnatal expenses under this cover. So if you have a 3 lakh cover, you will get 35,000

64
00:05:20,086 --> 00:05:25,966
 of maternity coverage and if you have a 5 lakh cover, then it is 50k. But as we mentioned,

65
00:05:26,186 --> 00:05:32,806
 please keep in mind the waiting periods. Carejoy also provides coverage for your newborn up to 90

66
00:05:32,806 --> 00:05:38,746
 days so if you have a cover of 3 lakh the newborn cover would be 30,000 and if it is

67
00:05:38,746 --> 00:05:46,186
 5 lakh then it is 50,000. Additionally Carejoy Tomorrow offers 50k for any birth defects

68
00:05:46,186 --> 00:05:52,526
 your newborn might have. Let's come to the add-ons. Although this add-on is not live

69
00:05:52,526 --> 00:05:58,806
 yet we will be talking about no claim bonanza where you get 100% of your sum assured as

70
00:05:58,806 --> 00:06:02,086
 bonus if you do not make a claim for 3 years.

71
00:06:02,086 --> 00:06:04,706
 So how much does this plan cost?

72
00:06:04,706 --> 00:06:09,926
 For this we have drawn a comparison between Carejoy today and Nivabopa Aspire Platinum

73
00:06:09,926 --> 00:06:10,926
 Plus.

74
00:06:10,926 --> 00:06:17,886
 So for an adult of 30 years of age the premiums would be around 74000 in Carejoy however in

75
00:06:17,886 --> 00:06:20,766
 Nivabopa the premiums would be 30000.

76
00:06:20,766 --> 00:06:27,526
 For 2 adults of 30 years of age Carejoy today would give a plan at 82000 but Nivabopa Aspire

77
00:06:27,526 --> 00:06:32,686
 platinum plus would be at 42,000 which is much cheaper. Now if we look at a

78
00:06:32,686 --> 00:06:38,026
 family floater for two adults and one child Carejoy today would cost you around

79
00:06:38,026 --> 00:06:44,126
 86,000 whereas Nivabopa would cost you around 54,000 so as you can see the

80
00:06:44,126 --> 00:06:48,586
 features of both these plans are pretty comparable but Carejoy today is very expensive.

81
00:06:48,586 --> 00:06:53,906
 Similarly we have compared Carejoy tomorrow with Nivabopa Aspire

82
00:06:53,906 --> 00:06:59,886
 Diamond Plus and Nivabupa Health Premia Silver. As you can see the premiums for this is also

83
00:06:59,886 --> 00:07:15,690
 very high Okay apart from the premiums are there any issues with this plan Yes limited sum assured So as we discussed this plan offers a cover of 3 lakh or 5 lakh which might not be enough given how the medical costs are increasing

84
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:18,690
 So it might be inadequate for you.

85
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:20,690
 Limited Features

86
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:26,690
 Carejoy has a lot of limits like room rent restrictions, co-pay clause etc which is not ideal.

87
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:32,690
 Basic features are there, we get it but there are lot of good features which other plans might offer at a cheaper rate.

88
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:34,690
 Pricey Premiums

89
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:38,870
 For the features that Carejoy is offering, there are other plans in the market that can

90
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:41,969
 give you these features at much less premiums.

91
00:07:41,969 --> 00:07:43,469
 Room rent restrictions.

92
00:07:43,469 --> 00:07:48,930
 As we said, we recommend plans having no room rent restrictions as such and this plan has

93
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:49,930
 one.

94
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:54,010
 So if you exceed this restriction, you will have to pay a very large share of your medical

95
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:57,570
 bill which is not ideal, anyway you are paying high premiums.

96
00:07:57,570 --> 00:08:03,290
 One another thing, Carejoy requires you to make a 3 year payment which means 3 years

97
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:09,510
 premiums ek saath. Already premiums itte high hai, wo bhi 3 saal ke would be very heavy on your pocket.

98
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:15,490
 So what does Ditto recommend? See the premiums are very high. So even if you took like a normal

99
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:20,370
 health plan and saved all that money, aapka maternity coverage mein utna hi kharcha hota.

100
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:25,969
 So it doesn't make a lot of sense to pay so high premiums for something which you would be able to

101
00:08:25,969 --> 00:08:33,130
 afford without one as well. So are there any better alternatives? Maybe. One, your corporate plan

102
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:35,330
 might offer you maternity cover.

103
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:38,610
 So if you opt one there, you don't need to get a separate coverage.

104
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:43,270
 Two, Nivabopa itself has a few plans which have better features,

105
00:08:43,410 --> 00:08:45,490
 better coverage and affordable premiums.

106
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:49,429
 For example, plans like Nivabopa Health Premia and Aspire

107
00:08:49,429 --> 00:08:53,189
 might offer you better features at affordable premiums.

108
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:57,630
 However, with Nivabopa, our experience has not been ideal.

109
00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:02,389
 For a case like a small dengue, we had to go through a lot of back and forth,

110
00:09:02,389 --> 00:09:04,330
 which is not ideal when you are making a claim.

111
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:06,929
 You are already very busy with your own things.

112
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:09,590
 So ideally, we would recommend an insurer

113
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:11,689
 where there is less back and forth like this.

114
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:15,830
 So finally, maternity cover lena aisa koi bahut necessary nahi hai.

115
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:18,610
 You can go for a simple health insurance also.

116
00:09:18,889 --> 00:09:21,970
 But what you want to take is ultimately your call.

117
00:09:22,429 --> 00:09:24,630
 So if you want to understand more about it

118
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:27,230
 or find the right health insurance plan for you,
