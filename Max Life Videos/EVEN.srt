1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,680
 Wait, you're telling me I can get unlimited doctor consultations, 24x7 personal medical

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:13,600
 support, free diagnostic tests and a 1 crore insurance cover all in one plan?

3
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:18,120
 Sounds more like a subscription to a luxury wellness service than health insurance, right?

4
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:21,600
 Well, that's what Even Health Insurance claims to offer.

5
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,840
 Yes, that's the name of the company.

6
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:24,840
 Even.

7
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:25,840
 Even Health Insurance.

8
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,760
 But here's the catch.

9
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,140
 Even isn't even an insurance company.

10
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:31,920
 So what are you actually buying?

11
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,760
 Hi folks, I'm Shashank from Ditto and in today's video, we're breaking down Even Health

12
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:42,240
 Insurance, what it offers, how it works and who it's for and more importantly, whether

13
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,300
 it's actually a good idea to buy it.

14
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:47,660
 And by the way, if you'd rather just talk to an expert instead of figuring it out all

15
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:49,440
 by yourself, book a free call with Ditto.

16
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,140
 We'll help you pick the right plan.

17
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:52,140
 Links in the description.

18
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,840
 So first, let's get this out of the way.

19
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,280
 What is Even?

20
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:02,260
 is not a licensed insurance company. It's actually a healthcare provider based in Bengaluru. Think of

21
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:06,760
 them as clinical services company that also bundles insurance in the background. This company was

22
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:12,500
 launched in 2020 by a team of founders, Mayank Banerjee, Matilda Giglio and Alessandro Lallango

23
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:17,580
 and is backed by Alpha Wave. Their model is simple. They give you unlimited consultations

24
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:35,388
 with doctors support from wellness coaches chronic disease management and 24 bar 7 personal and they bundle this with a group health insurance policy via Magma hdi now how does this actually work even works through a corporate agency that called houston insurance advisors

25
00:01:35,388 --> 00:01:41,448
 private limited which is iidi registered so the insurance part is legal and valid but it's offered

26
00:01:41,448 --> 00:01:48,148
 as a group plan not as an individual retail policy so you're not the policy holder even as you're

27
00:01:48,148 --> 00:01:54,228
 a member under the group umbrella which has some advantages but also some pretty big limitations

28
00:01:54,228 --> 00:02:00,308
 let's talk about what you actually get even offers three tiers of membership plan care essential and

29
00:02:00,308 --> 00:02:06,468
 plus even care is the most basic no insurance just online consultations with doctors and access to

30
00:02:06,468 --> 00:02:12,228
 their medical team 24 7. even essential adds in group insurance so now you get hospital coverage

31
00:02:12,228 --> 00:02:18,148
 too but no diagnostics or advanced features. Even Plus is a full package, includes up to

32
00:02:18,148 --> 00:02:23,668
 1 crore insurance per family, cashless hospitalization, COVID-19 cover, free diagnostic

33
00:02:23,668 --> 00:02:29,748
 consultations, emergency care. Well, sounds amazing, right? Let's actually look at the pros.

34
00:02:29,748 --> 00:02:34,468
 First, the preventive care angle is brilliant. You get access to general physicians, specialists,

35
00:02:34,468 --> 00:02:39,268
 nutritionists, psychologists anytime you want. So you're not waiting for a health problem to

36
00:02:39,268 --> 00:02:40,268
 to become serious.

37
00:02:40,268 --> 00:02:42,448
 You're managing your health actively.

38
00:02:42,448 --> 00:02:45,148
 Second, the integration of services is seamless.

39
00:02:45,148 --> 00:02:49,828
 Diagnostics, consultations and hospitalization, it's all handled in one place.

40
00:02:49,828 --> 00:03:01,216
 You don have to run between hospitals TPA insurer and back And third the pricing is quite reasonable for what included especially if you actually use the services often But here where the red flags begin

41
00:03:01,216 --> 00:03:03,216
 Even doesn't sell individual policy.

42
00:03:03,216 --> 00:03:07,216
 The insurance you get is a group cover, controlled entirely by Even.

43
00:03:07,216 --> 00:03:09,216
 You don't own the policy, you're just a member.

44
00:03:09,216 --> 00:03:12,216
 That means you can't customize your plan.

45
00:03:12,216 --> 00:03:14,216
 You don't get lifelong renewability,

46
00:03:14,216 --> 00:03:17,216
 and if Even decides to change their partnership with Magma HDI,

47
00:03:17,216 --> 00:03:20,216
 your cover could change too.

48
00:03:20,216 --> 00:03:21,256
 Now, that's a big deal.

49
00:03:21,576 --> 00:03:23,696
 Also, you can't port this policy if you leave.

50
00:03:24,056 --> 00:03:27,456
 You're not the policyholder, so portability doesn't apply.

51
00:03:27,636 --> 00:03:29,476
 You're essentially on a subscription model,

52
00:03:29,796 --> 00:03:32,856
 and if they shut down, your cover may disappear with them.

53
00:03:32,956 --> 00:03:34,956
 Second issue, limited physical presence.

54
00:03:34,956 --> 00:03:38,096
 Even only has offline clinics primarily in Bengaluru,

55
00:03:38,296 --> 00:03:40,016
 although they are expanding this network.

56
00:03:40,536 --> 00:03:43,016
 Yes, consultations are available online across India,

57
00:03:43,296 --> 00:03:45,616
 but if you're someone who prefers walking into a clinic,

58
00:03:45,996 --> 00:03:47,116
 this might be a limitation.

59
00:03:47,476 --> 00:03:48,696
 And third, coverage gaps.

60
00:03:48,696 --> 00:03:54,176
 The group insurance via Magma HDI might not offer the same level of depth as a good retail policy.

61
00:03:54,776 --> 00:04:02,636
 Things like bonus, organ transplants, maternity, advanced surgeries may have limits or exclusions that aren't obvious out front.

62
00:04:02,736 --> 00:04:10,336
 So, if you're someone who values long-term stability or wants a policy you can truly own and manage, even may not be the right bet.

63
00:04:10,516 --> 00:04:14,296
 Now, let's compare this with traditional health insurance plans in 2025.

64
00:04:14,296 --> 00:04:30,524
 With a good retail plan say Cash Supreme Neewa Bhopa Aspire or HDFC you the policy holder You can choose your sum insured and features like OPT or maternity reduce waiting periods and most importantly you can port your plan renew it lifelong

65
00:04:30,824 --> 00:04:32,304
 and manage it on your own terms.

66
00:04:32,584 --> 00:04:34,244
 Even doesn't give you that kind of flexibility.

67
00:04:34,924 --> 00:04:36,824
 But it's also not trying to be that.

68
00:04:37,364 --> 00:04:38,584
 Even is designed for people

69
00:04:38,584 --> 00:04:40,584
 who want full-stack healthcare access

70
00:04:40,584 --> 00:04:43,424
 and want someone else to handle all the logistics.

71
00:04:43,424 --> 00:04:45,124
 Think urban working professionals

72
00:04:45,124 --> 00:04:47,884
 who are tired of running from doctor to lab,

73
00:04:47,884 --> 00:04:54,044
 to hospital to tpa so if you value that convenience and don't mind the group insurance limitations

74
00:04:54,044 --> 00:05:00,084
 even could be a fit but still if you are unsure here's what you should do book a call with ditto

75
00:05:00,084 --> 00:05:05,024
 and we'll help you understand whether even is right for you or if you're better off with a

76
00:05:05,024 --> 00:05:09,164
 more traditional plan the link is in the description even health insurance is not

77
00:05:09,164 --> 00:05:13,944
 really insurance in the traditional sense it's a hybrid product a mix of telemedicine

78
00:05:13,944 --> 00:05:18,984
 diagnostics and group cover. That's great for everyday health support and preventive care.

79
00:05:18,984 --> 00:05:23,784
 But if your priority is a long-term protection, customization and flexibility, maternity,

80
00:05:23,784 --> 00:05:29,064
 tax benefits or portability, you're better off with a retail plan. In fact, many people buy both,

81
00:05:29,624 --> 00:05:34,344
 even for day-to-day health and a traditional policy for serious medical emergencies.

82
00:05:34,344 --> 00:05:39,464
 But again, it all depends on your goals and that's what we're here for. Book a free call with Ditto

83
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:40,744
 and we'll help you get it right.

84
00:05:41,024 --> 00:05:42,244
 The link is in the description.

85
00:05:42,904 --> 00:05:43,984
 Thanks for watching, folks.

86
00:05:44,124 --> 00:05:45,624
 So stay smart and stay covered

87
00:05:45,624 --> 00:05:47,404
 and I will see you in the next one.

88
00:05:47,684 --> 00:05:48,504
 Happy insurance hunting.
