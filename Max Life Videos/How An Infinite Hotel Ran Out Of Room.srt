1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 Imagine there's a hotel with infinite rooms.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 They're numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, and so on forever.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
 This is the Hilbert Hotel and you are the manager.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
 Now, it might seem like you could accommodate anyone who ever shows up,

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 but there is a limit, a way to exceed even the infinity of rooms at the Hilbert Hotel.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,620
 Well, to start, let's say only one person is allowed in each room and all the rooms

7
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:32,940
 are full.

8
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:37,920
 There are an infinite number of people in an infinite number of rooms.

9
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,000
 Then someone new shows up and they want a room.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,800
 But all the rooms are occupied, so what should you do?

11
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:49,560
 Well, a lesser manager might turn them away, but you know about infinity, so you get on

12
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:52,880
 the PA and you tell all the guests to move down a room.

13
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:56,640
 So the person in room one moves to room two, the one in room two moves to room three, and

14
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,500
 so on down the line.

15
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,660
 And now you can put the new guest in room one.

16
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:05,020
 If a bus shows up with a hundred people, you know exactly what to do.

17
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:10,120
 Just move everyone down a hundred rooms and put the new guests in their vacated rooms.

18
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:16,280
 But now say a bus shows up that is infinitely long, and it's carrying infinitely many people.

19
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:21,560
 You knew what to do with a finite number of people, but what do you do with infinite people?

20
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:25,280
 think about it for a minute and then come up with a plan.

21
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:39,753
 You tell each of your existing guests to move to the room with double their room number So the person in room 1 moves to room two room two moves to room four room three to room six and so on And now all of the odd

22
00:01:39,753 --> 00:01:45,233
 rooms are available. And you know there are an infinite number of odd numbers, so you can give

23
00:01:45,233 --> 00:01:52,133
 each person on the infinite bus a unique odd-numbered room. This hotel is really starting

24
00:01:52,133 --> 00:01:56,653
 to feel like it can fit everybody. And that's the beauty of infinity, it goes on forever.

25
00:01:57,553 --> 00:02:03,373
 And then, all of a sudden, more infinite buses show up. Not just one or two, but an infinite

26
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:10,633
 number of infinite buses. So what can you do? Well, you pull out an infinite spreadsheet,

27
00:02:10,773 --> 00:02:16,813
 of course. You make a row for each bus, bus 1, bus 2, bus 3, and so on, and a row at the top for

28
00:02:16,813 --> 00:02:21,853
 all the people who are already in the hotel. The columns are for the position each person

29
00:02:21,853 --> 00:02:29,193
 occupies. So you've got hotel room 1, hotel room 2, hotel room 3, etc. And then bus 1 seat 1,

30
00:02:29,373 --> 00:02:35,093
 bus 1 seat 2, bus 1 seat 3, and so on. So each person gets a unique identifier,

31
00:02:35,313 --> 00:02:41,093
 which is a combination of their vehicle and their position in it. So how do you assign the rooms?

32
00:02:41,093 --> 00:02:46,753
 We'll start in the top left corner and draw a line that zigzags back and forth across

33
00:02:46,753 --> 00:02:52,033
 the spreadsheet, going over each unique ID exactly once.

34
00:02:52,033 --> 00:02:57,773
 Then imagine you pull on the opposite ends of this line, straightening it out.

35
00:02:57,773 --> 00:03:11,146
 So we gone from an infinite by infinite grid to a single infinite line It then pretty simple just to line up each person on that line with a unique room in the hotel So everyone fits no problem

36
00:03:12,286 --> 00:03:19,586
 But now a big bus pulls up, an infinite party bus with no seats. Instead, everyone on board

37
00:03:19,586 --> 00:03:25,786
 is identified by their unique name, which is kind of strange. So their names all consist of only

38
00:03:25,786 --> 00:03:34,386
 two letters, A and B, but each name is infinitely long. So someone is named A, B, B, A, A, A, A, A,

39
00:03:34,386 --> 00:03:40,146
 A, A, A, and so on forever. Someone else is named A, B, A, B, A, B, A, B, A, B, et cetera.

40
00:03:40,786 --> 00:03:45,266
 On this bus, there's a person with every possible infinite sequence of these two letters.

41
00:03:46,006 --> 00:03:52,086
 Now, A, B, B, A, A, A, A, A, I'll call him Abba for short. He comes into the hotel to arrange the

42
00:03:52,086 --> 00:04:00,026
 rooms. But you tell him, sorry, there's no way we can fit all of you in the hotel. And he's like,

43
00:04:00,126 --> 00:04:04,426
 what do you mean? There's an infinite number of us and you have an infinite number of rooms.

44
00:04:04,646 --> 00:04:10,486
 Why won't this work? So you show him. You pull out your infinite spreadsheet again and start

45
00:04:10,486 --> 00:04:16,326
 assigning rooms to people on the bus. So you have room one, assign it to ABBA, and then room two to

46
00:04:16,326 --> 00:04:22,186
 ABABABAB repeating, and you keep going, putting a different string of A's and B's beside

47
00:04:22,186 --> 00:04:23,886
 each room number.

48
00:04:23,886 --> 00:04:26,126
 Now here's the problem, you tell Abba.

49
00:04:26,126 --> 00:04:29,046
 Let's say we have a complete infinite list.

50
00:04:29,046 --> 00:04:43,159
 I can still write down the name of a person who doesn yet have a room The way you do it is you take the first letter of the first name and flip it from an A to a B Then take the second letter of the second name and flip it from a B to an A

51
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:45,839
 And you keep doing this all the way down the list,

52
00:04:46,279 --> 00:04:51,899
 and the name you write down is guaranteed to appear nowhere on that list.

53
00:04:52,299 --> 00:04:54,959
 Because it won't match the first letter of the first name,

54
00:04:55,119 --> 00:04:57,979
 or the second letter of the second name, or the third letter of the third name.

55
00:04:57,979 --> 00:05:04,479
 it will be different from every name on the list by at least one character, the letter on the diagonal.

56
00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:11,859
 The number of rooms in the Hilbert Hotel is infinite, sure, but it is countably infinite,

57
00:05:12,299 --> 00:05:16,079
 meaning there are as many rooms as there are positive integers 1 to infinity.

58
00:05:16,699 --> 00:05:21,159
 By contrast, the number of people on the bus is uncountably infinite.

59
00:05:21,679 --> 00:05:26,699
 If you try to match up each one with an integer, you will still have people left over.

60
00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:30,839
 some infinities are bigger than others.

61
00:05:31,719 --> 00:05:36,039
 So there's a limit to the people that you can fit in the Hilbert Hotel.

62
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:41,019
 This is mind-blowing enough, but what's even crazier

63
00:05:41,019 --> 00:05:45,399
 is that the discovery of different sized infinities sparked a line of inquiry

64
00:05:45,399 --> 00:05:50,079
 that led directly to the invention of the device you're watching this on right now.

65
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:53,399
 But that's a story for another time.

66
00:05:56,699 --> 00:06:06,059
 Thank you.
