[0.00 - 5.00]  Imagine there's a hotel with infinite rooms.
[5.00 - 10.00]  They're numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, and so on forever.
[10.00 - 15.00]  This is the Hilbert Hotel and you are the manager.
[15.00 - 19.00]  Now, it might seem like you could accommodate anyone who ever shows up,
[19.00 - 26.00]  but there is a limit, a way to exceed even the infinity of rooms at the Hilbert Hotel.
[26.00 - 31.62]  Well, to start, let's say only one person is allowed in each room and all the rooms
[31.62 - 32.94]  are full.
[32.94 - 37.92]  There are an infinite number of people in an infinite number of rooms.
[37.92 - 41.00]  Then someone new shows up and they want a room.
[41.00 - 43.80]  But all the rooms are occupied, so what should you do?
[43.80 - 49.56]  Well, a lesser manager might turn them away, but you know about infinity, so you get on
[49.56 - 52.88]  the PA and you tell all the guests to move down a room.
[52.88 - 56.64]  So the person in room one moves to room two, the one in room two moves to room three, and
[56.64 - 58.50]  so on down the line.
[58.50 - 61.66]  And now you can put the new guest in room one.
[61.66 - 65.02]  If a bus shows up with a hundred people, you know exactly what to do.
[65.02 - 70.12]  Just move everyone down a hundred rooms and put the new guests in their vacated rooms.
[70.12 - 76.28]  But now say a bus shows up that is infinitely long, and it's carrying infinitely many people.
[76.28 - 81.56]  You knew what to do with a finite number of people, but what do you do with infinite people?
[81.56 - 85.28]  think about it for a minute and then come up with a plan.
[85.28 - 99.75]  You tell each of your existing guests to move to the room with double their room number So the person in room 1 moves to room two room two moves to room four room three to room six and so on And now all of the odd
[99.75 - 105.23]  rooms are available. And you know there are an infinite number of odd numbers, so you can give
[105.23 - 112.13]  each person on the infinite bus a unique odd-numbered room. This hotel is really starting
[112.13 - 116.65]  to feel like it can fit everybody. And that's the beauty of infinity, it goes on forever.
[117.55 - 123.37]  And then, all of a sudden, more infinite buses show up. Not just one or two, but an infinite
[123.37 - 130.63]  number of infinite buses. So what can you do? Well, you pull out an infinite spreadsheet,
[130.77 - 136.81]  of course. You make a row for each bus, bus 1, bus 2, bus 3, and so on, and a row at the top for
[136.81 - 141.85]  all the people who are already in the hotel. The columns are for the position each person
[141.85 - 149.19]  occupies. So you've got hotel room 1, hotel room 2, hotel room 3, etc. And then bus 1 seat 1,
[149.37 - 155.09]  bus 1 seat 2, bus 1 seat 3, and so on. So each person gets a unique identifier,
[155.31 - 161.09]  which is a combination of their vehicle and their position in it. So how do you assign the rooms?
[161.09 - 166.75]  We'll start in the top left corner and draw a line that zigzags back and forth across
[166.75 - 172.03]  the spreadsheet, going over each unique ID exactly once.
[172.03 - 177.77]  Then imagine you pull on the opposite ends of this line, straightening it out.
[177.77 - 191.15]  So we gone from an infinite by infinite grid to a single infinite line It then pretty simple just to line up each person on that line with a unique room in the hotel So everyone fits no problem
[192.29 - 199.59]  But now a big bus pulls up, an infinite party bus with no seats. Instead, everyone on board
[199.59 - 205.79]  is identified by their unique name, which is kind of strange. So their names all consist of only
[205.79 - 214.39]  two letters, A and B, but each name is infinitely long. So someone is named A, B, B, A, A, A, A, A,
[214.39 - 220.15]  A, A, A, and so on forever. Someone else is named A, B, A, B, A, B, A, B, A, B, et cetera.
[220.79 - 225.27]  On this bus, there's a person with every possible infinite sequence of these two letters.
[226.01 - 232.09]  Now, A, B, B, A, A, A, A, A, I'll call him Abba for short. He comes into the hotel to arrange the
[232.09 - 240.03]  rooms. But you tell him, sorry, there's no way we can fit all of you in the hotel. And he's like,
[240.13 - 244.43]  what do you mean? There's an infinite number of us and you have an infinite number of rooms.
[244.65 - 250.49]  Why won't this work? So you show him. You pull out your infinite spreadsheet again and start
[250.49 - 256.33]  assigning rooms to people on the bus. So you have room one, assign it to ABBA, and then room two to
[256.33 - 262.19]  ABABABAB repeating, and you keep going, putting a different string of A's and B's beside
[262.19 - 263.89]  each room number.
[263.89 - 266.13]  Now here's the problem, you tell Abba.
[266.13 - 269.05]  Let's say we have a complete infinite list.
[269.05 - 283.16]  I can still write down the name of a person who doesn yet have a room The way you do it is you take the first letter of the first name and flip it from an A to a B Then take the second letter of the second name and flip it from a B to an A
[283.52 - 285.84]  And you keep doing this all the way down the list,
[286.28 - 291.90]  and the name you write down is guaranteed to appear nowhere on that list.
[292.30 - 294.96]  Because it won't match the first letter of the first name,
[295.12 - 297.98]  or the second letter of the second name, or the third letter of the third name.
[297.98 - 304.48]  it will be different from every name on the list by at least one character, the letter on the diagonal.
[305.94 - 311.86]  The number of rooms in the Hilbert Hotel is infinite, sure, but it is countably infinite,
[312.30 - 316.08]  meaning there are as many rooms as there are positive integers 1 to infinity.
[316.70 - 321.16]  By contrast, the number of people on the bus is uncountably infinite.
[321.68 - 326.70]  If you try to match up each one with an integer, you will still have people left over.
[326.70 - 330.84]  some infinities are bigger than others.
[331.72 - 336.04]  So there's a limit to the people that you can fit in the Hilbert Hotel.
[337.08 - 341.02]  This is mind-blowing enough, but what's even crazier
[341.02 - 345.40]  is that the discovery of different sized infinities sparked a line of inquiry
[345.40 - 350.08]  that led directly to the invention of the device you're watching this on right now.
[350.76 - 353.40]  But that's a story for another time.
[356.70 - 366.06]  Thank you.
