1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,080
 You already know how term insurance works.

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:05,680
 You pay the insurance company a small fee every year to protect your downside

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:10,160
 and in the event of your passing, the insurance pays out a large sum of money to your family.

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:14,160
 Today, I will tell you how you can enhance your base term policy

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:19,200
 to increase its ability to protect you and your family better with something called as RIDERS.

6
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:19,840
 By using...

7
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:22,960
 PIZZAS!

8
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,240
 Yep, I'm not kid...

9
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:26,480
 Not kidding.

10
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:30,320
 Your margarita is your base plan.

11
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,920
 It covers your sum in short.

12
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:33,440
 That's it.

13
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:34,880
 Plain term plan.

14
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,280
 Now, let's assume you want to enrich your plan.

15
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,640
 This is where RIDERS come in.

16
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,960
 You have several options in the market like...

17
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:46,160
 Waiver of premium, critical illness, terminal illness, life stage benefit, zero cost option,

18
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,520
 accidental death, accidental disability and so on.

19
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,880
 And just like how not all toppings belong to your base plan...

20
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,640
 Like your pineapple.

21
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:59,840
 Not all RIDERS are necessary and recommended by us.

22
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,600
 Let's say, accidental death rider.

23
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,800
 By adding this rider to your base term insurance plan,

24
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:09,600
 additional coverage is provided to the nominee the policy holder's death results from an accident.

25
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,480
 This rider typically comes with a relatively affordable premium.

26
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:16,080
 If you travel very frequently and seek additional accidental coverage,

27
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,480
 opting for this very rider could be beneficial.

28
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:23,120
 However, at Ditto, we advise choosing a sufficient base cover with a good summer shot

29
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:28,240
 that provides coverage for all types of death, regardless of whether they are accidental or not.

30
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:36,080
 Some insurers provide an extra benefit with the base cover of term insurance to address

31
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:41,440
 total permanent disabilities and this is called income on permanent disability cover.

32
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:46,560
 This additional benefit may be offered as a lump sum by some insurers,

33
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,160
 while others provide it as a monthly income for up to 10 years,

34
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:52,560
 following a total permanent disability diagnosis.

35
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,240
 While the likelihood of experiencing permanent disabilities is low,

36
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,440
 this add-on typically comes with an affordable premium.

37
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:02,240
 According to Ditto, while it's not essential,

38
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:06,480
 it could be beneficial to have this add-on for added financial security.

39
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:17,040
 Now, there are some toppings, say like your onions, that are mostly on most of the pizzas

40
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:22,080
 and just like that, life stage benefit may be a part of your plan.

41
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,840
 With this rider, you can increase the summer shot later in life,

42
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:31,680
 such as upon marriage or upon childbirth, when you have more number of dependents to look after.

43
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:36,000
 Some insurers also provide voluntary top-up options,

44
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,160
 allowing policyholders to increase coverage regardless of major life events.

45
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:50,000
 ICICI iProtect Smart, Tata AI Sampoon Raksha Plus, HDFC Care to Protect Smart and Bajaj E-Touch

46
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,840
 offer life stage benefits as inbuilt.

47
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:57,600
 Max Life Smart Secure Plus offers top-up, but the plan is since discontinued and the current

48
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:02,480
 step i.e. Smart Total Elite Protection offers neither top-up nor life stage.

49
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:06,800
 Both life stage and top-ups are capped to a specific amount and subject to conditions,

50
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,480
 and the premiums increase proportionally when the sum assured is increased.

51
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:19,760
 There is also the zero cost option, in which you receive all premiums back at no additional expense.

52
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:25,520
 Most leading term plans include the zero cost option, though it comes with very specific terms

53
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:29,840
 and conditions that vary among insurers. These conditions typically specify the minimum

54
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:34,320
 duration the policy must be held, conditions for exiting the plan and other factors.

55
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:39,040
 Nevertheless, as an inbuilt feature, this zero cost option is beneficial to have

56
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,320
 and provides flexibility to exit the plan if necessary.

57
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:47,440
 HDFC Care to Protect Smart, ICICI iProtect Smart, Max Life Insurance, Smart Total Elite

58
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,160
 Protection, and Bajaj Etouch offer it inbuilt.

59
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:54,640
 Lastly, there is Terminal Illness. This is when a medical practitioner believes that a person is

60
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:59,440
 going to die within six months due to any terminal illness, and the insurer will release the sum

61
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:04,080
 insured to the holder and the family upon the certification from the medical practitioner.

62
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,880
 However, the likelihood of a medical practitioner issuing such a certification is relatively low.

63
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:14,000
 While the rider may not seem practical, it is an inbuilt feature with most of the plans which comes

64
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:18,960
 free of cost. HDFC Care to Protect Smart, ICICI iProtect Smart, Max Life Insurance,

65
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:25,680
 Smart Total Elite Protection, Bajaj Etouch, and Tata AI Sampoona Raksha Plus, and MRSS offer it

66
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:31,440
 inbuilt. And finally, let's come to two riders that are highly recommended and that you should

67
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:37,040
 have. You see, life is really unpredictable, just like how the pizzas on my table are, and there are

68
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:42,720
 numerous illnesses on rice. God forbid someone gets cancer and they're not able to work, there is no

69
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:47,440
 income, then who will look after the family? That is where the critical illness rider comes in.

70
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:53,440
 The critical illness feature provides a lump sum payout upon diagnosis of any critical illness.

71
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:59,040
 Specified in the policy document, this amount can be utilized without any restrictions imposed by

72
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:04,000
 the insurer. Policyholders can use it for income replacement or to cover additional medical expenses

73
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 arising from the critical illness. Although you can argue that the cost of the medical expenses

74
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,800
 can be taken care by comprehensive health insurance, critical illness feature is still useful

75
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:17,840
 as an income replacement during tough times. There is another rider which is a cost-effective

76
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:22,480
 option and has beneficial additions to a term insurance policy considering its price and

77
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:28,240
 functioning. At Ditto, we strongly recommend this rider to be included in the term plan. This is

78
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:33,600
 waiver of premium. This feature ensures that all future premiums are waived off if the policyholder

79
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:38,880
 is diagnosed with a critical illness or suffers from total permanent disability, mostly due to an

80
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:43,920
 accident as specified in the policy document. Some term plans cover both critical illness and total

81
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:48,720
 permanent disabilities due to accidents, while others only cover total permanent disabilities

82
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:55,760
 due to accidents or terminal illness. Now you see you can always opt in for a pure margarita pizza

83
00:05:55,760 --> 00:06:00,720
 that is a base plan with inbuilt riders, but then you always have the option to enhance it with

84
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:06,240
 several other toppings which are not here or riders in our case. These riders are good to

85
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:13,760
 have and not needed than not to have and need it. Now that's all folks see you in the next one and

86
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,640
 happy insurance hunting!
