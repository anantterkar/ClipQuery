[0.00 - 2.08]  You already know how term insurance works.
[2.08 - 5.68]  You pay the insurance company a small fee every year to protect your downside
[5.68 - 10.16]  and in the event of your passing, the insurance pays out a large sum of money to your family.
[10.16 - 14.16]  Today, I will tell you how you can enhance your base term policy
[14.16 - 19.20]  to increase its ability to protect you and your family better with something called as RIDERS.
[19.20 - 19.84]  By using...
[21.76 - 22.96]  PIZZAS!
[22.96 - 24.24]  Yep, I'm not kid...
[25.76 - 26.48]  Not kidding.
[27.44 - 30.32]  Your margarita is your base plan.
[30.32 - 31.92]  It covers your sum in short.
[32.80 - 33.44]  That's it.
[33.44 - 34.88]  Plain term plan.
[34.88 - 37.28]  Now, let's assume you want to enrich your plan.
[37.28 - 38.64]  This is where RIDERS come in.
[38.64 - 40.96]  You have several options in the market like...
[40.96 - 46.16]  Waiver of premium, critical illness, terminal illness, life stage benefit, zero cost option,
[46.16 - 49.52]  accidental death, accidental disability and so on.
[49.52 - 52.88]  And just like how not all toppings belong to your base plan...
[53.52 - 54.64]  Like your pineapple.
[56.88 - 59.84]  Not all RIDERS are necessary and recommended by us.
[59.84 - 61.60]  Let's say, accidental death rider.
[61.60 - 64.80]  By adding this rider to your base term insurance plan,
[64.80 - 69.60]  additional coverage is provided to the nominee the policy holder's death results from an accident.
[69.60 - 72.48]  This rider typically comes with a relatively affordable premium.
[72.48 - 76.08]  If you travel very frequently and seek additional accidental coverage,
[76.08 - 78.48]  opting for this very rider could be beneficial.
[78.48 - 83.12]  However, at Ditto, we advise choosing a sufficient base cover with a good summer shot
[83.20 - 88.24]  that provides coverage for all types of death, regardless of whether they are accidental or not.
[91.52 - 96.08]  Some insurers provide an extra benefit with the base cover of term insurance to address
[96.08 - 101.44]  total permanent disabilities and this is called income on permanent disability cover.
[102.08 - 106.56]  This additional benefit may be offered as a lump sum by some insurers,
[106.56 - 110.16]  while others provide it as a monthly income for up to 10 years,
[110.16 - 112.56]  following a total permanent disability diagnosis.
[112.56 - 116.24]  While the likelihood of experiencing permanent disabilities is low,
[116.24 - 119.44]  this add-on typically comes with an affordable premium.
[119.44 - 122.24]  According to Ditto, while it's not essential,
[122.24 - 126.48]  it could be beneficial to have this add-on for added financial security.
[126.48 - 137.04]  Now, there are some toppings, say like your onions, that are mostly on most of the pizzas
[137.04 - 142.08]  and just like that, life stage benefit may be a part of your plan.
[142.08 - 145.84]  With this rider, you can increase the summer shot later in life,
[145.84 - 151.68]  such as upon marriage or upon childbirth, when you have more number of dependents to look after.
[152.32 - 156.00]  Some insurers also provide voluntary top-up options,
[156.00 - 160.16]  allowing policyholders to increase coverage regardless of major life events.
[163.12 - 170.00]  ICICI iProtect Smart, Tata AI Sampoon Raksha Plus, HDFC Care to Protect Smart and Bajaj E-Touch
[170.00 - 171.84]  offer life stage benefits as inbuilt.
[171.84 - 177.60]  Max Life Smart Secure Plus offers top-up, but the plan is since discontinued and the current
[177.60 - 182.48]  step i.e. Smart Total Elite Protection offers neither top-up nor life stage.
[182.48 - 186.80]  Both life stage and top-ups are capped to a specific amount and subject to conditions,
[186.80 - 190.48]  and the premiums increase proportionally when the sum assured is increased.
[190.48 - 199.76]  There is also the zero cost option, in which you receive all premiums back at no additional expense.
[199.76 - 205.52]  Most leading term plans include the zero cost option, though it comes with very specific terms
[205.52 - 209.84]  and conditions that vary among insurers. These conditions typically specify the minimum
[209.84 - 214.32]  duration the policy must be held, conditions for exiting the plan and other factors.
[214.32 - 219.04]  Nevertheless, as an inbuilt feature, this zero cost option is beneficial to have
[219.04 - 222.32]  and provides flexibility to exit the plan if necessary.
[222.32 - 227.44]  HDFC Care to Protect Smart, ICICI iProtect Smart, Max Life Insurance, Smart Total Elite
[227.92 - 230.16]  Protection, and Bajaj Etouch offer it inbuilt.
[230.16 - 234.64]  Lastly, there is Terminal Illness. This is when a medical practitioner believes that a person is
[234.64 - 239.44]  going to die within six months due to any terminal illness, and the insurer will release the sum
[239.44 - 244.08]  insured to the holder and the family upon the certification from the medical practitioner.
[244.08 - 248.88]  However, the likelihood of a medical practitioner issuing such a certification is relatively low.
[248.88 - 254.00]  While the rider may not seem practical, it is an inbuilt feature with most of the plans which comes
[254.08 - 258.96]  free of cost. HDFC Care to Protect Smart, ICICI iProtect Smart, Max Life Insurance,
[258.96 - 265.68]  Smart Total Elite Protection, Bajaj Etouch, and Tata AI Sampoona Raksha Plus, and MRSS offer it
[265.68 - 271.44]  inbuilt. And finally, let's come to two riders that are highly recommended and that you should
[271.44 - 277.04]  have. You see, life is really unpredictable, just like how the pizzas on my table are, and there are
[277.04 - 282.72]  numerous illnesses on rice. God forbid someone gets cancer and they're not able to work, there is no
[282.72 - 287.44]  income, then who will look after the family? That is where the critical illness rider comes in.
[287.44 - 293.44]  The critical illness feature provides a lump sum payout upon diagnosis of any critical illness.
[293.44 - 299.04]  Specified in the policy document, this amount can be utilized without any restrictions imposed by
[299.04 - 304.00]  the insurer. Policyholders can use it for income replacement or to cover additional medical expenses
[304.00 - 308.00]  arising from the critical illness. Although you can argue that the cost of the medical expenses
[308.00 - 312.80]  can be taken care by comprehensive health insurance, critical illness feature is still useful
[312.80 - 317.84]  as an income replacement during tough times. There is another rider which is a cost-effective
[317.84 - 322.48]  option and has beneficial additions to a term insurance policy considering its price and
[322.48 - 328.24]  functioning. At Ditto, we strongly recommend this rider to be included in the term plan. This is
[328.24 - 333.60]  waiver of premium. This feature ensures that all future premiums are waived off if the policyholder
[333.60 - 338.88]  is diagnosed with a critical illness or suffers from total permanent disability, mostly due to an
[338.88 - 343.92]  accident as specified in the policy document. Some term plans cover both critical illness and total
[343.92 - 348.72]  permanent disabilities due to accidents, while others only cover total permanent disabilities
[348.72 - 355.76]  due to accidents or terminal illness. Now you see you can always opt in for a pure margarita pizza
[355.76 - 360.72]  that is a base plan with inbuilt riders, but then you always have the option to enhance it with
[360.72 - 366.24]  several other toppings which are not here or riders in our case. These riders are good to
[366.24 - 373.76]  have and not needed than not to have and need it. Now that's all folks see you in the next one and
[374.96 - 376.64]  happy insurance hunting!
