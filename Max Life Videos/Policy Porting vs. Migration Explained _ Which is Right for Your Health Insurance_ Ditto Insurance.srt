2

 Today, we are going to break down both concepts and help you understand exactly when to choose which option.

 Now, let's start with the basics.

7
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:31,360
 And I mean crystal clear definitions that'll help you understand everything that follows.

8
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,920
 Policy migration is when you switch from one health insurance plan to another

9
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,340
 while staying with the same insurance company.

10
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:41,040
 Think of it as an internal upgrade or change.

11
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:45,980
 For example, you might migrate from basic plan to a premium plan with better coverage,

12
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,980
 all within the same insurance company.

13
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:52,080
 Porting, on the other hand, is when you switch your entire policy

14
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:54,480
 from one insurance company to another.

15
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,380
 like switching your sim from Airtel to Jio.

16
00:00:57,380 --> 00:01:00,880
 The key here is that you get to keep your accumulated benefits.

17
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:11,276
 Yes those waiting periods you already served stay intact Now let break down the crucial difference between porting and migration First let talk timing With porting you can only make

18
00:01:11,276 --> 00:01:16,236
 the switch during policy renewal and you need to give your insurer advance notice, typically 45 to

19
00:01:16,236 --> 00:01:22,876
 60 days before renewal. Migration is more flexible. Most insurers allow you to migrate plans at any

20
00:01:22,876 --> 00:01:28,936
 time during your policy period. Second, let's discuss documentation. Porting requires significant

21
00:01:28,936 --> 00:01:34,736
 paperwork. You'll need to fill out portability forms, provide KYC documents, submit your existing

22
00:01:34,736 --> 00:01:39,456
 policy details and share your complete claims history. Migration? Much simpler. Since you're

23
00:01:39,456 --> 00:01:43,476
 staying with the same insurer, they already know you, so they have all your information.

24
00:01:43,956 --> 00:01:49,216
 Third, let's take a look at the premiums. When you port, your new insurer will assess your risk

25
00:01:49,216 --> 00:01:53,816
 profile and set premiums accordingly. With migration, while premiums might change based

26
00:01:53,816 --> 00:01:57,916
 on your new plan's features, they usually stay relatively similar since you're with the same

27
00:01:57,916 --> 00:02:02,856
 insurer. Now the big question, when should you port and when should you migrate? Choose

28
00:02:02,856 --> 00:02:18,991
 porting when you are unhappy with your current insurer service you found another insurer with better claim settlement ratios you want access to a broader hospital network or you found significantly better coverage options with another insurer Choose migration when you

29
00:02:18,991 --> 00:02:25,331
 satisfied with your current insurance company, but you need different features and want to avoid the

30
00:02:25,331 --> 00:02:30,451
 hassle of changing insurers. You also want a quicker, simpler process with less documentation,

31
00:02:30,891 --> 00:02:36,091
 and you're looking to upgrade or modify your coverage within the same company. And finally,

32
00:02:36,091 --> 00:02:40,551
 you're moving from a group policy to an individual policy within the same insurer.

33
00:02:41,051 --> 00:02:45,811
 Now, here's something crucial to understand. Both options protect your continuity benefits.

34
00:02:46,211 --> 00:02:51,171
 This means your waiting periods for pre-existing conditions and any no claim bonuses that you have

35
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:56,611
 accumulated won't go to waste. However, always read the fine print of your new policy, whether

36
00:02:56,611 --> 00:03:02,211
 you're porting or migrating. Now, let's address some questions that you guys have already asked us.

37
00:03:02,211 --> 00:03:07,131
 Will my premium definitely increase if I port or migrate?

38
00:03:07,131 --> 00:03:11,771
 Not necessarily, with porting it depends on the new insurers assessment, with migration

39
00:03:11,771 --> 00:03:26,147
 it primarily depends on the features of your new plan Next can I change my sum insured during porting or migration Yes you can But remember for a higher sum insured you might need to undergo medical tests especially when porting

40
00:03:26,467 --> 00:03:32,247
 What happens to my ongoing treatment if I port or migrate? Now, your coverage continues seamlessly,

41
00:03:32,427 --> 00:03:37,067
 but make sure to disclose any ongoing treatments during application process. So folks, here's the

42
00:03:37,067 --> 00:03:41,967
 bottom line. Both porting and migration are valuable tools that give you flexibility with

43
00:03:41,967 --> 00:03:46,787
 your health insurance coverage. If you're unhappy with your insurer's service or find better option

44
00:03:46,787 --> 00:03:50,887
 elsewhere, porting might be your best bet. If you're looking for different features but are

45
00:03:50,887 --> 00:03:55,767
 satisfied with your current insurer, migration is probably the best way to go. Remember, the goal

46
00:03:55,767 --> 00:03:59,867
 is to have the best possible health coverage for your needs. Don't stick with a plan that's not

47
00:03:59,867 --> 00:04:04,187
 serving you well just because change seems daunting. Whether you choose to port or migrate,

48
00:04:04,267 --> 00:04:07,607
 the important thing is to make an informed decision based on your specific needs and

49
00:04:07,607 --> 00:04:11,447
