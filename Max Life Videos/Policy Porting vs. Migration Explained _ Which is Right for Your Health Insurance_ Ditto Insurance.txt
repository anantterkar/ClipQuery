[0.00 - 8.58]  After our last video on policy porting, many of you asked about policy migration and how it differs from porting.
[8.68 - 13.40]  Today, we are going to break down both concepts and help you understand exactly when to choose which option.
[13.56 - 16.46]  Hi folks, I'm Shashank and you're watching Ditto Insurance.

[26.04 - 27.60]  Now, let's start with the basics.
[27.90 - 31.36]  And I mean crystal clear definitions that'll help you understand everything that follows.
[31.76 - 35.92]  Policy migration is when you switch from one health insurance plan to another
[35.92 - 38.34]  while staying with the same insurance company.
[38.72 - 41.04]  Think of it as an internal upgrade or change.
[41.38 - 45.98]  For example, you might migrate from basic plan to a premium plan with better coverage,
[46.32 - 47.98]  all within the same insurance company.
[48.50 - 52.08]  Porting, on the other hand, is when you switch your entire policy
[52.08 - 54.48]  from one insurance company to another.
[54.48 - 57.38]  like switching your sim from Airtel to Jio.
[57.38 - 60.88]  The key here is that you get to keep your accumulated benefits.
[60.88 - 71.28]  Yes those waiting periods you already served stay intact Now let break down the crucial difference between porting and migration First let talk timing With porting you can only make
[71.28 - 76.24]  the switch during policy renewal and you need to give your insurer advance notice, typically 45 to
[76.24 - 82.88]  60 days before renewal. Migration is more flexible. Most insurers allow you to migrate plans at any
[82.88 - 88.94]  time during your policy period. Second, let's discuss documentation. Porting requires significant
[88.94 - 94.74]  paperwork. You'll need to fill out portability forms, provide KYC documents, submit your existing
[94.74 - 99.46]  policy details and share your complete claims history. Migration? Much simpler. Since you're
[99.46 - 103.48]  staying with the same insurer, they already know you, so they have all your information.
[103.96 - 109.22]  Third, let's take a look at the premiums. When you port, your new insurer will assess your risk
[109.22 - 113.82]  profile and set premiums accordingly. With migration, while premiums might change based
[113.82 - 117.92]  on your new plan's features, they usually stay relatively similar since you're with the same
[117.92 - 122.86]  insurer. Now the big question, when should you port and when should you migrate? Choose
[122.86 - 138.99]  porting when you are unhappy with your current insurer service you found another insurer with better claim settlement ratios you want access to a broader hospital network or you found significantly better coverage options with another insurer Choose migration when you
[138.99 - 145.33]  satisfied with your current insurance company, but you need different features and want to avoid the
[145.33 - 150.45]  hassle of changing insurers. You also want a quicker, simpler process with less documentation,
[150.89 - 156.09]  and you're looking to upgrade or modify your coverage within the same company. And finally,
[156.09 - 160.55]  you're moving from a group policy to an individual policy within the same insurer.
[161.05 - 165.81]  Now, here's something crucial to understand. Both options protect your continuity benefits.
[166.21 - 171.17]  This means your waiting periods for pre-existing conditions and any no claim bonuses that you have
[171.17 - 176.61]  accumulated won't go to waste. However, always read the fine print of your new policy, whether
[176.61 - 182.21]  you're porting or migrating. Now, let's address some questions that you guys have already asked us.
[182.21 - 187.13]  Will my premium definitely increase if I port or migrate?
[187.13 - 191.77]  Not necessarily, with porting it depends on the new insurers assessment, with migration
[191.77 - 206.15]  it primarily depends on the features of your new plan Next can I change my sum insured during porting or migration Yes you can But remember for a higher sum insured you might need to undergo medical tests especially when porting
[206.47 - 212.25]  What happens to my ongoing treatment if I port or migrate? Now, your coverage continues seamlessly,
[212.43 - 217.07]  but make sure to disclose any ongoing treatments during application process. So folks, here's the
[217.07 - 221.97]  bottom line. Both porting and migration are valuable tools that give you flexibility with
[221.97 - 226.79]  your health insurance coverage. If you're unhappy with your insurer's service or find better option
[226.79 - 230.89]  elsewhere, porting might be your best bet. If you're looking for different features but are
[230.89 - 235.77]  satisfied with your current insurer, migration is probably the best way to go. Remember, the goal
[235.77 - 239.87]  is to have the best possible health coverage for your needs. Don't stick with a plan that's not
[239.87 - 244.19]  serving you well just because change seems daunting. Whether you choose to port or migrate,
[244.27 - 247.61]  the important thing is to make an informed decision based on your specific needs and
[247.61 - 251.45]  circumstances. If you found this explanation helpful, don't forget to like and subscribe
