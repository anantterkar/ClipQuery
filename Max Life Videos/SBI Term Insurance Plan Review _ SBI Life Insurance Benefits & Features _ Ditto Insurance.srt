00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,900
 Today we're looking into SBI Life Insurance, one of the biggest names in India's insurance landscape.

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:09,080
 They offer four distinctive term plans, each designed to cater to different needs,

3
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:14,520
 lifestyles and financial goals. Whether you're looking for basic coverage or more personalized

4
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:20,200
 protection with advanced customization options, SBI Life has something for everyone. By the end

5
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:25,100
 of the video, you'll know which plan could be the best fit for you. Before we dive into the plans,

6
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:31,740
 let's look at their performance. With a claim settlement ratio of 98.62% for 2023-24 and

7
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:37,920
 annual business reaching 38,238 crores, they're a solid player in the market, right up there with

8
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:44,220
 other major players like HDFC Life and MaxLife. The annual business demonstrates SBI Life's strong

9
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:49,820
 market presence and operational efficiency which are important factors to consider when choosing

10
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:56,240
 a term plan. When comparing term plans with other players like HDFC Life and Max Life, this figure

11
00:00:56,240 --> 00:01:02,160
 can signal how well the insurer is equipped to honour the claims and maintain financial health

12
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:07,780
 over the time. Now, let's get into their four main term plans and examine them in detail.

13
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:14,260
 First up is eShield Next, SBI's most comprehensive term plan. It has an extensive coverage with

14
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:18,960
 multiple riders. It's also affordable and offers three cover options, level cover benefit,

15
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,840
 the nominee receives a fixed sum assured upon the policyholder's death.

16
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:24,360
 Increasing cover benefit.

17
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:27,560
 The sum assured increases by 10% every 5 years

18
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:32,080
 up to double the initial amount or until the policyholder turns 71.

19
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:35,500
 And third, level cover with future-proofing benefit.

20
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,380
 This allows increasing the cover amount during significant life events

21
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:41,560
 without additional underwriting.

22
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:53,904
 eShield Next also includes a terminal illness benefit inbuilt into the plan providing up to 2 crores if diagnosed with a terminal illness Let me explain this Say you diagnosed with a terminal illness benefit inbuilt into the plan providing up to 2 crores if diagnosed with a terminal illness Let me explain this Say you diagnosed with a terminal ailment

23
00:01:54,144 --> 00:01:58,084
 The doctors, one from your end and one from the insurer's team,

24
00:01:58,324 --> 00:02:03,184
 offer a written declaration of a poor prognosis with only a few months to live.

25
00:02:03,404 --> 00:02:08,024
 In this case, the insurer offers a sum of up to 2 crores to the policyholder,

26
00:02:08,284 --> 00:02:11,664
 provided the diagnosis is conducted within the policy tenure

27
00:02:11,664 --> 00:02:14,804
 or before the policyholder turns 80.

28
00:02:15,004 --> 00:02:18,524
 However, if the terminal illness amount is less than the base cover,

29
00:02:19,004 --> 00:02:22,024
 the balance is paid out in the event of the policyholder's death.

30
00:02:22,304 --> 00:02:25,804
 Also, this amount can be paid out as lump sum,

31
00:02:26,364 --> 00:02:30,824
 a monthly installment or a combination of a lump sum and a monthly installment.

32
00:02:30,824 --> 00:02:34,484
 There are other optional riders that you can select with this plan.

33
00:02:34,724 --> 00:02:36,244
 One is Better Half Benefit,

34
00:02:36,344 --> 00:02:40,004
 which provides 25 lakhs coverage for your spouse after your death.

35
00:02:40,004 --> 00:02:45,004
 This cover stays intact till the maturity year of the base plan as chosen by the primary policyholder.

36
00:02:45,304 --> 00:02:49,224
 Upon the diagnosis of terminal illness or in the event of the death of the spouse,

37
00:02:49,484 --> 00:02:54,184
 the insurer pays you 25 lakhs as a lump sum in the mode of a level cover

38
00:02:54,184 --> 00:02:57,644
 irrespective of the payment option chosen of the base policy.

39
00:02:57,944 --> 00:02:59,884
 Accidental death benefit, which we all know,

40
00:03:00,304 --> 00:03:03,964
 that is if the policyholder passes away within 120 days of the accident,

41
00:03:04,464 --> 00:03:09,084
 the insurer pays the accidental death benefit rider some assured to the nominee.

42
00:03:09,084 --> 00:03:11,784
 Accidental total and permanent disability benefit

43
00:03:11,784 --> 00:03:16,224
 If the policyholder is left totally and permanently disabled due to an accident,

44
00:03:16,724 --> 00:03:20,224
 the insurer offers an assured sum to the policyholder.

45
00:03:20,544 --> 00:03:22,084
 Next plan is a smart shield.

46
00:03:22,344 --> 00:03:29,544
 SBI's most popular term plan offering coverage from 25 lakhs to an amount determined by the underwriter.

47
00:03:29,544 --> 00:03:44,628
 There is an option to add a couple of riders and also customize your plan here Well it has two variants First level term assurance Here fixed death benefit is equal to the chosen sum assured Both riders are capped at 50 lakh rupees and cannot exceed the base sum assured

48
00:03:44,888 --> 00:03:49,328
 SmartShield is a popular plan because it is simpler, much more affordable,

49
00:03:49,828 --> 00:03:53,788
 making it appealing to people who want a basic, cost-effective term insurance

50
00:03:53,788 --> 00:03:55,268
 without extra frills.

51
00:03:55,268 --> 00:03:59,748
 Whereas eShield Next that we discussed before this offers increasing coverage,

52
00:03:59,748 --> 00:04:04,288
 life-stage milestone boosts, future-proofing and flexible payout options,

53
00:04:04,648 --> 00:04:08,668
 making it ideal for someone with evolving financial needs over time.

54
00:04:08,908 --> 00:04:14,708
 So if you're someone who wants a no-frills plan with minimal investment but decent protection,

55
00:04:15,248 --> 00:04:16,948
 we suggest you to go with SmartShield.

56
00:04:17,248 --> 00:04:23,168
 But if you want long-term, adaptable coverage that increases as your responsibilities would grow,

57
00:04:23,848 --> 00:04:25,928
 then eShield Next is your better bet.

58
00:04:25,928 --> 00:04:32,868
 Moving on, catering to the low-income population, SBI Life also has a Grameen Bhima Pure Term Insurance Plan,

59
00:04:33,248 --> 00:04:40,508
 which is affordable while also offering lower range of coverage, extending from Rs. 10,000 to Rs. 50,000.

60
00:04:41,028 --> 00:04:47,268
 While there is the standard death benefit perk available under this plan, there are no other riders available,

61
00:04:47,268 --> 00:04:51,908
 and the only mode of premium payment available is a single-time payment

62
00:04:51,908 --> 00:04:59,268
 since the premiums are as low as Rs. 300 up to a maximum of Rs. 2000 only.

63
00:04:59,268 --> 00:05:04,148
 Lastly, we have Aarogya Shield, a unique combination of pure term and health insurance

64
00:05:04,148 --> 00:05:06,188
 from their SBI General Insurance.

65
00:05:06,408 --> 00:05:11,528
 The term insurance component offers coverage from Rs. 5 lakh to Rs. 2.5 crores.

66
00:05:11,688 --> 00:05:13,868
 It provides death benefit with no riders

67
00:05:13,868 --> 00:05:19,148
 and the health insurance component includes coverage from 1 lakh rupees to 3 lakhs

68
00:05:19,148 --> 00:05:32,873
 and it covers OPD in admission costs daycare treatments ambulance charges pre and post hospitalization expenses maternity charges hiv aids treatment costs and etc but note that there a two

69
00:05:32,873 --> 00:05:39,673
 waiting period for pre-existing conditions arogya shield by sbi is a plan which gives you coverage

70
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:46,793
 for your health as well as term now we at ditto don't recommend such products because they might

71
00:05:46,793 --> 00:05:53,753
 not be a very good health insurance plan, neither a very good term plan. And we always recommend you

72
00:05:53,753 --> 00:06:00,053
 to go with pure term plan or pure health plan. Now let's compare SBI Life's premiums with

73
00:06:00,053 --> 00:06:06,153
 competitors. For a 1 crore term plan for 30 year old non-smoker male, here are your premiums.

74
00:06:06,293 --> 00:06:11,313
 Clearly, SBI's premiums are on the higher side when you compare it with other players like HDFC

75
00:06:11,313 --> 00:06:18,433
 Life, ICICI Prudential and Max Life. SBI Life is a major player in Indian life insurance market

76
00:06:18,433 --> 00:06:23,953
 with a scale comparable to HDFC Life. While their term plans are generally on the pricier side,

77
00:06:24,173 --> 00:06:29,273
 they lack certain key features that many buyers might be looking for. For example, SBI Life does

78
00:06:29,273 --> 00:06:35,313
 not offer critical illness coverage as an add-on, which provides additional payouts upon diagnosis

79
00:06:35,313 --> 00:06:39,833
 of conditions like cancer or heart attacks. Additionally, they don't have waiver of premium

80
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:45,513
 add-on which waves off future premiums in case of critical illness or permanent disability.

81
00:06:45,513 --> 00:06:51,033
 That being said, SBI Life's claim settlement ratio is impressive, slightly above the industry

82
00:06:51,033 --> 00:06:58,153
 average at 97%. If you are looking for a reliable no-frills term plan with high CSR, then SBI Life

83
00:06:58,153 --> 00:07:03,673
 is a good option. Remember, the right term plan depends on your specific needs and budget. Always

84
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:08,953
 compare multiple options before making a decision. Thanks for watching this detailed look at SBI

85
00:07:08,953 --> 00:07:12,513
 life's term plans. I'll see you in the next one. Happy insurance hunting.
