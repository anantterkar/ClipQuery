1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 Okay, so let me ask you this, if someone told you that two term plans can give both, give

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,600
 your money back and give you a flexibility, but cost very differently, would you know

3
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:11,960
 how to choose?

4
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:17,220
 Because today we are comparing two heavyweights, Axis Max Life's Smart Term Plan Plus and

5
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:19,320
 Bajaj Alliance Life's eTouch 2.

6
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:24,760
 And trust me, while they may look very similar on the surface, there are some serious differences

7
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:26,080
 once you dig a little deeper.

8
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:29,680
 Hello folks, I'm Shashank from Return Insurance and if you're confused about which term

9
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:34,640
 plan is genuinely better for you, don't stress. Book a free call with our advisors and we'll help

10
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:40,640
 you figure it out calmly and simply. No spam, no pushy sales. Link is in the description. And yes,

11
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:45,360
 our services, they're totally free. Alright, let's jump straight into the comparison. First,

12
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:50,320
 a quick background. Axis Maxlife is one of the most reliable insurers in the market today. Their

13
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:55,920
 CSR is one of the best in the industry and they've got a solid Axis bank back in now and operationally

14
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,180
 they've been getting stronger every year. Bajaj Alliance Life on the other hand brings a powerful

15
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:05,600
 combination of Indian trust and global expertise. Its solvency ratio is over 5.1 times which is

16
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:10,680
 insane stability and their claims settlement ratio over 99% and it is one of the highest in the

17
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:16,100
 industry. So should I trust them with my money point of view? Both are solid, no issues. Now

18
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:21,220
 coming to the plans. STPP is Axis Max Life's flagship term plan. It replaced their older

19
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:28,680
 step plan. The beauty of STPP is flexibility. You can pick from seven different variants. But honestly, for most people, only two make real sense.

20
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:45,308
 The regular cover and the smart cover Bajaj Alliance eTouch 2 meanwhile keeps it simpler It offers a standard life shield variant an accidental cover variant and a return of premium option But the biggest kicker It comes with an inbuilt zero cost exit option that genuinely a game changer

21
00:01:45,308 --> 00:01:46,988
 So let's do a proper head to head.

22
00:01:46,988 --> 00:01:48,908
 First, let's talk about coverage structure.

23
00:01:48,908 --> 00:01:54,588
 In STPP's regular cover, you get simple lump sum death payout, no fancy changes over time.

24
00:01:54,588 --> 00:01:56,828
 Just plain solid term insurance.

25
00:01:56,828 --> 00:01:59,548
 In E-Touch 2's base variant, it's the same.

26
00:01:59,548 --> 00:02:01,548
 Clean term insurance but with a twist.

27
00:02:01,548 --> 00:02:08,508
 If you've crossed a minimum number of years and hit 860, you can actually surrender the policy and get back all your premiums.

28
00:02:08,508 --> 00:02:12,828
 And if you choose longer terms with limited pay, you might even get 2x the premiums back.

29
00:02:13,148 --> 00:02:15,288
 This feature is called 2x special exit.

30
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:17,788
 This 2x special exit is in both the plans.

31
00:02:18,128 --> 00:02:22,148
 Axis Max Life launched it first and then Bajaj and ICICI launched it as well.

32
00:02:22,448 --> 00:02:27,048
 However, IRDI has directed them that they cannot give back 2x the premium paid.

33
00:02:27,428 --> 00:02:31,388
 So with that direction, ICICI has already retracted the 2x benefit.

34
00:02:31,548 --> 00:02:35,588
 Axis Maxlife and Bajaj would do it in the second half of May tentatively.

35
00:02:35,948 --> 00:02:37,568
 Now, what about plan flexibility?

36
00:02:37,908 --> 00:02:40,368
 Axis Maxlife STPP gives you 7 variant options.

37
00:02:40,508 --> 00:02:43,248
 Apart from regular cover, there's smart cover, rebalancing cover,

38
00:02:43,368 --> 00:02:46,508
 ROP options, whole life covers and even income protection options.

39
00:02:46,508 --> 00:02:49,608
 It's designed for people who want slightly customized structures

40
00:02:49,608 --> 00:02:52,588
 based on liabilities like home loans, education expenses, etc.

41
00:02:52,948 --> 00:02:54,808
 Bajaj Alliance, on the other hand, keeps it simple.

42
00:02:55,128 --> 00:02:57,948
 The E-Touch 2 plan says, you want basic cover? Take it.

43
00:02:58,148 --> 00:02:59,828
 Want early exit options? Take it.

44
00:02:59,828 --> 00:03:02,628
 Want critical illness or family protection riders?

45
00:03:02,628 --> 00:03:03,828
 Here, add them.

46
00:03:03,828 --> 00:03:06,428
 It's super streamlined without making you feel lost

47
00:03:06,428 --> 00:03:08,168
 in a sea of complicated variants.

48
00:03:08,168 --> 00:03:20,657
 Now let touch on zero cost exit versus special exit value Balik eTouch 2 offers zero cost exit if you cross 60 and meet minimum policy term criteria of 35 years You can exit anytime after 70 and take your premiums back

49
00:03:20,877 --> 00:03:23,017
 STPP, however, offers special exit.

50
00:03:23,357 --> 00:03:27,037
 You can exit and take premiums back starting from the 30th policy year,

51
00:03:27,357 --> 00:03:29,637
 but not during the last 4 years of the policy term.

52
00:03:30,077 --> 00:03:33,437
 Also, you need minimum 40-year policy terms to get this benefit.

53
00:03:33,777 --> 00:03:37,177
 Slightly more restrictive compared to Balik's clean zero-cost feature.

54
00:03:37,177 --> 00:03:40,337
 Now let's talk about premiums because money matters, right?

55
00:03:40,337 --> 00:03:45,977
 At age 30, for a non-smoker and salaried male for 1 crore cover till the age of 65,

56
00:03:46,377 --> 00:03:51,657
 STPP plan costs about Rs. 11,960 and second year onwards Rs. 14,000.

57
00:03:52,197 --> 00:03:56,837
 E-Touch 2 costs around Rs. 12,500 and second year onwards Rs. 14,800.

58
00:03:57,417 --> 00:04:00,457
 Slightly cheaper for STPP but not by a huge margin.

59
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:03,757
 As you increase the sum assured to 2 crore or 3 crore,

60
00:04:04,057 --> 00:04:06,437
 E-Touch 2 actually becomes more price efficient,

61
00:04:06,437 --> 00:04:09,077
 especially after you factor in the discounts that Bajaj offers.

62
00:04:09,377 --> 00:04:12,497
 5% for salaried profile, 5% if you're new to life insurance,

63
00:04:12,677 --> 00:04:14,297
 and another 6% for buying online.

64
00:04:14,617 --> 00:04:18,437
 With Axis Max Life, you get a chunky 15% discount for salaried individuals,

65
00:04:18,597 --> 00:04:20,477
 but it's only on first-year premiums.

66
00:04:20,697 --> 00:04:23,537
 So, price-wise, if you plan to hold the policy for a long time,

67
00:04:23,717 --> 00:04:26,977
 Bajaj might edge out slightly due to consistent value across the top.

68
00:04:27,217 --> 00:04:28,517
 Now, onto riders and add-ons.

69
00:04:28,797 --> 00:04:31,717
 Both plans offer critical illness riders, accidental death riders,

70
00:04:31,877 --> 00:04:33,097
 and waiver of premium riders.

71
00:04:33,097 --> 00:04:38,777
 But Bacharach now allows you to stack a critical illness rider that covers up to 60 illnesses

72
00:04:38,777 --> 00:04:41,777
 while Axis Maxlife covers up to 64 illnesses.

73
00:04:41,777 --> 00:04:45,277
 Also, Balik's new Family Protect rider is very interesting.

74
00:04:45,277 --> 00:04:56,585
 It provides a lifelong monthly income for your parents if something happens to you It emotional planning and it very niche but very nice to have as well Now claims experience Both have instant payout on claim information

75
00:04:57,005 --> 00:05:00,585
 Both pay up to Rs 2 lakh paid within one working day of claim registration

76
00:05:00,585 --> 00:05:02,485
 even before full verification happens.

77
00:05:02,985 --> 00:05:07,065
 This can really help families during emotional emergencies like funerals or immediate costs.

78
00:05:07,425 --> 00:05:09,305
 Now, let's talk solvency and complaints.

79
00:05:09,705 --> 00:05:13,545
 Bajaj solvency ratio is an eye-popping 5.1 times,

80
00:05:13,545 --> 00:05:16,905
 meaning it's financially one of the most secure insurers out there today.

81
00:05:16,905 --> 00:05:20,985
 Axis Maxlife solvency is good too but not as crazy high,

82
00:05:20,985 --> 00:05:23,385
 around 2x which is also the industry average.

83
00:05:23,385 --> 00:05:25,065
 Complaints ratio are low for both,

84
00:05:25,065 --> 00:05:28,905
 but Bajaj Edge is slightly better with 4.4 complaints per 10,000

85
00:05:28,905 --> 00:05:30,985
 compared to Axis at around 7 to 8.

86
00:05:30,985 --> 00:05:33,065
 Alright, final comparison takeaway,

87
00:05:33,065 --> 00:05:35,305
 if you're someone who wants maximum flexibility,

88
00:05:35,305 --> 00:05:39,145
 wants the cleanest early exit option and doesn't want to overthink variants,

89
00:05:39,145 --> 00:05:42,425
 Bajaj Alliance eTouch 2 is a super practical option.

90
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:46,665
 But if you love customization like tailoring your plans based on liabilities,

91
00:05:46,665 --> 00:05:50,265
 want niche covers like smart cover with boosted coverage in early years,

92
00:05:50,265 --> 00:05:54,825
 waiver of premium on critical inners as well as want a salary discount upfront

93
00:05:54,825 --> 00:05:59,305
 in a good chunk, Axis Maxlife STPP gives you way more configuration power.

94
00:05:59,865 --> 00:06:01,465
 And again, if you're still thinking,

95
00:06:01,465 --> 00:06:05,945
