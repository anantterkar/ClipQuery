[0.00 - 6.00]  This presentation and this one were created using ChartGPT and if you stick around for a few minutes,
[6.00 - 13.00]  I'm going to show you two genius methods you can follow to create amazing PowerPoint presentation just like this one.
[13.00 - 14.00]  Let's get started.
[14.00 - 19.00]  Method 1. Imagine getting your PowerPoint ready with just a few clicks.
[19.00 - 24.00]  It's possible with the power of Visual Basic for Application or VPA.
[24.00 - 34.00]  Visual Basic for Application is a powerful programming language that allows you to automate tasks in Microsoft Office applications like PowerPoint.
[34.00 - 37.00]  Now let's get started with our first method.
[37.00 - 41.00]  We are going to create a presentation about the beautiful island of Mauritius.
[41.00 - 43.00]  Here is how you do it.
[43.00 - 50.00]  Open ChartGPT and type write me VBA PowerPoint code on holidaying in Mauritius.
[50.00 - 52.00]  Use hit slides.
[52.00 - 57.00]  Immediately ChartGPT will start generating the VBA codes.
[60.00 - 64.00]  Once the code is ready, scroll up and click on copy code.
[64.00 - 72.00]  Before we use the codes, please note that you should not run codes copied from the internet on your computer unless you trust the source.
[72.00 - 80.00]  Now open PowerPoint, navigate to file tab, select options and then click on customize ribbon.
[80.00 - 85.00]  On the right, on the main tabs, scroll down until you see developer option.
[85.00 - 90.00]  Check the option and click OK to add it to your tabs.
[90.00 - 93.00]  Click on the developer tab you just added.
[93.00 - 95.00]  Then select Visual Basic.
[95.00 - 99.00]  Open insert user form drop down and click on module.
[99.00 - 104.00]  Alternatively, you can use Alt plus F11 to access it.
[104.00 - 108.00]  Right click within the model window and paste the code you copied.
[108.00 - 111.00]  Then click the play button to run the code.
[113.00 - 119.00]  The VBA code has created 8 slides, each slide having its heading, subheading and body text.
[119.00 - 124.00]  But this presentation is not ready yet. Let's beautify it with the help of designer.
[124.00 - 127.00]  Select the first slide and click on designer.
[127.00 - 134.00]  It's like having an AI assistant that generates beautiful slide designs based on your content.
[134.00 - 139.00]  I'll go for the second result and you'll be amazed at the transformation.
[139.00 - 146.00]  Now we can move through the rest of the slides and designer will continue to generate design suggestions for us.
[146.00 - 153.00]  After going through all 8 slides, you'll have a polished presentation ready to impress your audience.
[153.00 - 157.00]  If you're not comfortable with running codes on your PC, I get it.
[157.00 - 163.00]  And that is why the second method I'm about to show you is for those who want to take advantage of ChatGPT
[163.00 - 167.00]  but without the risk of running VBA codes on their PC.
[167.00 - 175.00]  Method 2. With this method, we are going to first ask ChatGPT to generate a presentation outline for us.
[175.00 - 180.00]  Let's create a pitch deck presentation for a startup using the following prompt.
[180.00 - 183.00]  You are an expert in creating pitch decks.
[183.00 - 190.00]  Generate a PowerPoint presentation pitch deck for a startup that specializes in reducing food waste.
[191.00 - 196.00]  Structure the presentation into the following sections.
[198.00 - 206.00]  Problem, Solution, Business Model, Competition, Marketing Plan and Fundraising.
[209.00 - 212.00]  Use a maximum of 8 slides.
[220.00 - 223.00]  Select the result and copy it.
[223.00 - 227.00]  Next, open a blank Word document. Right click on the page.
[227.00 - 234.00]  Under paste options, select image formatting to paste the content without formatting it.
[234.00 - 239.00]  Now let's do some cleanup and remove the parts we don't need.
[239.00 - 243.00]  The next stage is crucial but before that, make sure to save the file.
[243.00 - 249.00]  To prepare this Word document for PowerPoint, we have to format it in a certain way.
[249.00 - 253.00]  Open View tab and click on outline.
[253.00 - 258.00]  Now press down the control key and select the slide add-ins.
[261.00 - 265.00]  Click on body text and select level 1.
[266.00 - 272.00]  Press down control key once again and select the bullet points for each section.
[274.00 - 277.00]  Go to body text and click on level 2.
[277.00 - 280.00]  Save the file and close outline view.
[280.00 - 283.00]  Now the content is ready for export to PowerPoint.
[283.00 - 287.00]  Close the Word document and open a blank PowerPoint presentation.
[287.00 - 291.00]  Click on new slide and select slides from outline.
[291.00 - 297.00]  Locate the Word document you saved earlier and click on insert or double click on it to insert.
[297.00 - 302.00]  PowerPoint will take a few seconds to convert each section to a slide.
[302.00 - 308.00]  Obviously this slide falls short of what a pitch deck should look like and that is where PowerPoint designer comes in.
[308.00 - 312.00]  Select the first slide and click on designer.
[312.00 - 315.00]  Let's go for the first one.
[316.00 - 319.00]  Now it's beginning to look like a pitch deck right?
[319.00 - 322.00]  Let's do same for slide 2 up to the last slide.
[322.00 - 330.00]  If you want to change or use a different design for any slide, just click on the slide and designer will generate new design styles.
[330.00 - 333.00]  Let's see the final result.
[334.00 - 338.00]  And this wraps up this tutorial. I hope you found it informative.
