1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
 What's the fastest way to board an airplane?

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,960
 I mean, you can't just throw open the gates like funneling cattle into a chute.

3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,600
 That's not for us. We're primates after all.

4
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:20,600
 So let's put our monkey brains to work to tackle this cue, which is what boarding groups do.

5
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:24,560
 Prioritize plainly packing primates precisely. Primarily.

6
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:28,920
 Okay, we have a suggestion. Pour people into the plane back to front.

7
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,560
 This is an intuitive solution to fill a cylinder.

8
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:36,440
 But there's almost a law of the universe that solutions which are the first thing you think of

9
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:42,160
 and look sensible and are easy to implement are often terrible, ineffective solutions

10
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:46,120
 once implemented will drag on civilization forever.

11
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:48,900
 Cough voting systems cough.

12
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:53,480
 So it should come as no surprise that this method is not good.

13
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:56,700
 And also what most airlines use to board their planes.

14
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:57,780
 Let's watch it in action.

15
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:00,280
 The first boarding group walks to the back of the plane.

16
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:05,220
 Everything is smooth, right until the first to go reaches their row and starts to stow.

17
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:06,660
 So slow.

18
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,660
 And for passenger two, while their seat is in view, there's nothing to do.

19
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:15,440
 The aisles one queue, where all can not but stew stuck like glue until this guy's through.

20
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:16,520
 Phew.

21
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:18,120
 It's bags.

22
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:21,440
 Bags cause most of the delay boarding a flight.

23
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:23,680
 Like with this, a full stop stow.

24
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:31,640
 When it happens, everyone boarding the plane within and without must wait until one person finishes stowing their bag.

25
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:38,000
 Can you feel it? The aggregate lost seconds of human life piling up like a bounty for a delighted reaper?

26
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:41,560
 Of course you can. You can feel it with every bag.

27
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,040
 Uh, what was I saying?

28
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:48,580
 Right, back-to-front boarding groups have a lot of full-stop stows, and very few of what you want.

29
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:51,400
 Pull-aways and parallels and parallels and pull-aways.

30
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:57,700
 Pullaways turn one queue into two and parallels decrease total bag stow time and are super satisfying.

31
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:13,864
 The rare triple partner parallel invoking a double high five at the sheer pleasure of its efficiency But loading back to front lets few of these happen Now say you weren just not good at designing boarding groups but you were malicious and wanted to maximize the

32
00:02:13,864 --> 00:02:23,304
 amount of human life wasted on a flight. What would you do? Not back to front, but front to back. The

33
00:02:23,304 --> 00:02:28,684
 smaller the boarding group, the better. This makes almost every tedious shuffle forward result in a

34
00:02:28,684 --> 00:02:35,644
 full stop stow because most of the line waits by rows already full or outside the plane.

35
00:02:35,644 --> 00:02:36,644
 Look familiar?

36
00:02:36,644 --> 00:02:40,024
 This is where we acknowledge the class structure of airplanes.

37
00:02:40,024 --> 00:02:44,824
 Real planes look like this and first class boards first, front to back, before the pro-economy

38
00:02:44,824 --> 00:02:46,724
 file in back to front.

39
00:02:46,724 --> 00:02:51,664
 So excluding pre-boarding, all airlines start with a little of the slowest boarding method

40
00:02:51,664 --> 00:02:53,664
 you could intentionally design.

41
00:02:53,664 --> 00:02:58,304
 Now obviously this video will soon reveal faster boarding procedures, and you will wonder,

42
00:02:58,304 --> 00:03:00,684
 Why don't airlines use the faster methods?

43
00:03:00,684 --> 00:03:04,144
 One possible answer is economic incentives.

44
00:03:04,144 --> 00:03:09,304
 First class pays for perks, sometimes breathtaking perks for breathtaking amounts, and boarding

45
00:03:09,304 --> 00:03:10,804
 first is one of them.

46
00:03:10,804 --> 00:03:15,224
 Also, airlines give everyone loyalty points that move you up the class structure the more

47
00:03:15,224 --> 00:03:16,904
 you fly with that airline.

48
00:03:16,904 --> 00:03:21,124
 Which gives airlines another good reason to group people, and probably helps explain why

49
00:03:21,124 --> 00:03:26,064
 they switched away from the older, faster method you won't believe they used to use.

50
00:03:26,064 --> 00:03:29,924
 Hey everyone, plane's here. Go ahead.

51
00:03:30,864 --> 00:03:35,724
 Doing nothing and having people board the flight in whatever order they show up to get their assigned seat

52
00:03:35,724 --> 00:03:38,524
 is faster than organizing tidy boarding groups.

53
00:03:38,744 --> 00:03:41,464
 This is because random people are spread, well, randomly,

54
00:03:41,684 --> 00:03:43,804
 increasing the chances of pull-aways and parallels,

55
00:03:43,984 --> 00:03:46,884
 unlike the more orderly methods airlines have switched to.

56
00:03:47,124 --> 00:03:50,604
 Man, it's always frustrating to know that to literally have done nothing

57
00:03:50,604 --> 00:03:52,864
 would be faster than the something that is done.

58
00:03:52,864 --> 00:03:59,984
 But surely there's a better boarding group order to be found if we can just subtract malice and add thinking to this problem.

59
00:03:59,984 --> 00:04:03,944
 Ah, three groups. Window, middle, aisle, in that order.

60
00:04:03,944 --> 00:04:08,444
 This is really the same as doing random thrice, one for each column of the craft,

61
00:04:08,444 --> 00:04:21,447
 but the reason it a smidge faster is because it eliminates the other source of boarding delay seat shuffles When people board randomly seat shuffling is going to happen a bunch and when people spill into the aisle it slows the queue

62
00:04:21,447 --> 00:04:25,887
 Ordering everyone by window middle aisle ensures a seat shuffle will never happen.

63
00:04:25,887 --> 00:04:28,367
 This seems like it should be a big improvement,

64
00:04:28,367 --> 00:04:31,687
 but when you simulate boarding an aircraft with a ton of real math,

65
00:04:31,687 --> 00:04:34,327
 rather than just animating it in a dramatically simplified fashion,

66
00:04:34,327 --> 00:04:39,887
 or do actual experiments, the seat shuffle just isn't a big deal compared to bag stowage.

67
00:04:39,887 --> 00:04:45,387
 People wrangling their one bag that won't possibly fit, or trying to get on board with three bags

68
00:04:45,387 --> 00:04:49,947
 because they don't think the rules should apply to them, who then also fiddle around with getting their laptops out after stowing them,

69
00:04:49,947 --> 00:04:52,727
 those kinds of delays count for much more.

70
00:04:52,727 --> 00:04:58,167
 So window middle aisle is maybe a smidge faster than random, which is good, and some airlines use this method,

71
00:04:58,167 --> 00:05:03,687
 which gets their planes turned around faster than back to front, while still giving them boarding groups to play games with.

72
00:05:03,687 --> 00:05:09,007
 The vast majority of airlines use either back to front or window middle aisle, so keep an

73
00:05:09,007 --> 00:05:13,007
 eye out next time you're boarding a flight, or which is happening to you.

74
00:05:13,007 --> 00:05:14,527
 But can we go farther?

75
00:05:14,527 --> 00:05:19,947
 Leaving the real world with its class systems and people and untidiness and smells, ascending

76
00:05:19,947 --> 00:05:24,827
 to the platonic plane of physics, where cows are spheres and people cellular automaton

77
00:05:24,827 --> 00:05:26,887
 who will execute instructions perfectly.

78
00:05:26,887 --> 00:05:32,507
 Here in the Celestia, what is the theoretically fastest way to board a plane?

79
00:05:32,507 --> 00:05:52,827
 On this level, here is what's possible.

80
00:05:52,827 --> 00:05:58,427
 To achieve this ballet, there are no boarding groups, but everyone stands in an exact order.

81
00:05:58,427 --> 00:06:03,827
 back to front in alternating rows on alternating sides, windows in.

82
00:06:03,827 --> 00:06:09,127
 This maximizes pullaways and parallels, pristinely packing people in a pinch.

83
00:06:09,127 --> 00:06:13,767
 Witnessing such glory is too much for mortal minds to bear for long, so we are forced to

84
00:06:13,767 --> 00:06:26,131
 descend back down into the meat world The cacophony the smell where we must stuff monkeys into a tube monkeys with families where separating their young invites chaos and cleanup

85
00:06:26,351 --> 00:06:28,751
 where economic incentives divide to profit,

86
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:30,711
 and where, even at their best,

87
00:06:30,991 --> 00:06:34,871
 the human inability to follow instructions is breathtaking.

88
00:06:38,131 --> 00:06:41,851
 Here, people, upon seeing boarding group 123,

89
00:06:42,491 --> 00:06:43,871
 would flip the hell out,

90
00:06:43,871 --> 00:06:48,391
 Let alone the impossibility of trying to get them to stand in line in order,

91
00:06:48,571 --> 00:06:54,131
 and where, even if faster, like watching seconds of a clock, people would complain it was slower.

92
00:06:55,431 --> 00:06:57,611
 Such gifts we were not meant to have.

93
00:06:58,071 --> 00:07:02,931
 But is there a way we can modify this perfection to improve our lot on this plane?

94
00:07:03,431 --> 00:07:03,811
 Yes.

95
00:07:04,151 --> 00:07:10,411
 Instead of exact order, boarding group the first would be all one side of the plane in every other row.

96
00:07:10,411 --> 00:07:14,331
 Boarding group the second, the other side, then back, and back again.

97
00:07:14,591 --> 00:07:16,091
 One, two, three, four.

98
00:07:16,451 --> 00:07:18,111
 We can't ask people for more.

99
00:07:18,531 --> 00:07:23,291
 This shadow of the perfect method has a chance of working in the real world,

100
00:07:23,411 --> 00:07:27,051
 with benefits like letting humans with families and friends board together,

101
00:07:27,211 --> 00:07:29,911
 giving airlines boarding groups they can still play with,

102
00:07:29,971 --> 00:07:32,731
 and still being faster than the current methods.

103
00:07:33,131 --> 00:07:35,931
 Reaching for perfection, we will always come up short.

104
00:07:35,931 --> 00:07:39,751
 But perhaps we can manage to get closer in the process.

105
00:07:40,411 --> 00:07:47,931
 Oh, before you go, let me leave you with an annoying thought.

106
00:07:47,931 --> 00:07:52,231
 You know how boarding a flight from front to back by row is the slowest possible method?

107
00:07:52,671 --> 00:07:53,531
 The Reaper method?

108
00:07:54,071 --> 00:07:57,451
 Well, after your flight, when the plane pulls into the gate,

109
00:07:57,751 --> 00:08:03,131
 and everyone ignores the flight attendant's admonishment to wait until the fastened seatbelt is off to grab their bag,

110
00:08:03,511 --> 00:08:06,011
 and the door opens, how do we deplane?

111
00:08:06,451 --> 00:08:09,131
 That's right. Front to back, row by row.

112
00:08:09,131 --> 00:08:11,751
 No slower could we go.
