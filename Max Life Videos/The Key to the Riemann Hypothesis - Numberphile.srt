1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,640
 Yeah, so we're going to be talking about L-functions.

2
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:06,480
 I want to give give you an example first of all of one L-function that I think you probably

3
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:13,080
 would recognize and this is the Riemann Zeta function which depends on a complex number.

4
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:19,140
 S is x plus i y. i here is the square root of minus 1 and

5
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:26,520
 you can define it either by a sum over the integers, all the integers, all the positive ones, or

6
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:31,880
 Or, and this is a great discovery of Euler, you can write it as a product over the prime numbers.

7
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:35,900
 And so the zeta function encodes information about the primes.

8
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:41,920
 It contains all the primes, and if you can unravel how the information in the zeta function is encoded,

9
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:43,800
 you can determine properties of the primes.

10
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,020
 That's one of the L functions.

11
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:49,220
 Now let me tell you a little bit more about the Riemann zeta function, because that's going to be part of the story.

12
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:54,520
 So the Riemann zeta function is defined as a sum over the integers or a product over the primes,

13
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:59,860
 and these these formally work if x is greater than 1. But it turns out you can

14
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,420
 find formulae that match these when x is greater than 1,

15
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:09,080
 when x is less than 1 work as well, and here's what the Riemann zeta function looks like.

16
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:15,360
 So these formally work to the right of the line x equals 1, so they work out here.

17
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:21,220
 And they tell you the value of the zeta function anywhere in this region.

18
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:26,740
 Now it turns out the zeta function has this amazing symmetry which was discovered by Riemann,

19
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:32,600
 which says that the line that I've drawn in blue there that passes through the point one half,

20
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,740
 that's a symmetry line of the Riemann zeta function.

21
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:38,380
 So if I know the value of the zeta function at some point here,

22
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:43,840
 I reflect that point through the blue line to get a point here, and know its value here.

23
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,460
 So I can determine that very easily.

24
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:48,560
 So Riemann's reflection formula, the symmetry formula,

25
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:53,760
 tells us that because I know the zeta function in this range, I also know it in this range.

26
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:54,520
 That's the reflection.

27
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,780
 So that just leaves this strip, which we don't understand.

28
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,240
 And this strip is where the zeta function is really mysterious.

29
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:07,260
 We know that in this strip, there are infinitely many points where the zeta function takes the value 0.

30
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:09,920
 The belief is, and this is called the Riemann hypothesis,

31
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:16,380
 that these points where the zeta function takes the value 0 all lie exactly on the symmetry line.

32
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:18,880
 And this is called the Riemann hypothesis.

33
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,000
 And this is one of the great mysteries of mathematics.

34
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:28,120
 Riemann hypothesised this in 1859, and it's been tested hugely since.

35
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:33,800
 Professor, it's well known in mathematics that if any mathematician can prove the Riemann hypothesis,

36
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,440
 he or she is destined for greatness.

37
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:36,840
 Yeah.

38
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:37,620
 Why?

39
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:43,240
 Well, because the Riemann zeta function encodes information about the prime.

40
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:48,760
 So if we know the positions of the zeros, that tells us really important information about the prime numbers.

41
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:51,440
 What information? What does it tell you that you don't already know?

42
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,580
 It tells us things we already suspect because we sort of believe the Riemann hypothesis is true,

43
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,380
 but there are things we can't prove.

44
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:02,480
 So, for example, how many primes are there up to a trillion?

45
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:16,814
 We have a formula for that that we believe is true but we can only prove that formula if we know the Riemann hypothesis is true So it like a whole bunch of houses would suddenly have a foundation Absolutely and there are whole books written assuming the truth of the Riemann hypothesis

46
00:03:16,814 --> 00:03:22,014
 So the foundations of our understanding of the primes would disappear if the Riemann

47
00:03:22,014 --> 00:03:23,674
 hypothesis turned out to be false.

48
00:03:23,674 --> 00:03:27,754
 It's known there are infinitely many zeros of the Riemann zeta function inside the critical

49
00:03:27,754 --> 00:03:32,874
 strip and it's known that at least 40% of those do lie on the symmetry line.

50
00:03:32,874 --> 00:03:39,694
 known, and this is a result of hugely extensive computations, that the first 10 trillion zeros

51
00:03:39,694 --> 00:03:45,654
 lie exactly on the symmetry line. That's the first 10,000 billion. It's known that batches

52
00:03:45,654 --> 00:03:52,694
 of zeros much higher up, beyond the 10 trillionth, lie on the line. So I think the world record

53
00:03:52,694 --> 00:03:58,794
 at the moment is there's a batch of zeros up beyond the 10 to the 36th zero. That is

54
00:03:58,794 --> 00:04:02,954
 the billion billion billion billionth zero, somewhere up there there's a whole batch of

55
00:04:02,954 --> 00:04:07,254
 them which we know lie exactly on the line. So people have put a huge effort into this.

56
00:04:07,254 --> 00:04:12,154
 And there's a long history of this. Alan Turing, when he built the first electronic computer,

57
00:04:12,154 --> 00:04:15,774
 one of the first things he did was compute the zeros of the zeta function. He found about

58
00:04:15,774 --> 00:04:20,114
 the first thousand lie on the line. Professor, if a mathematician one day finds

59
00:04:20,114 --> 00:04:26,414
 a zero in the strip but not on the line, is that mathematician going to be a hero or a

60
00:04:26,414 --> 00:04:32,494
 Well, they would certainly be very famous, and I think people would, mathematicians are very sanguine about this.

61
00:04:32,494 --> 00:04:34,994
 They'll just accept the truth. They want to know the truth.

62
00:04:35,474 --> 00:04:41,294
 So that person would be famous, but I think it would be a kind of ugly kind of fame, not a beautiful kind of fame.

63
00:04:41,434 --> 00:04:43,794
 So we've got these properties, and this is what I want to emphasise.

64
00:04:43,854 --> 00:04:48,674
 We can write the zeta function as a sum over the integers, or as a product over the primes,

65
00:04:48,894 --> 00:04:53,054
 and the zeta function has a symmetry line, a reflection symmetry line,

66
00:04:53,054 --> 00:04:58,654
 and we believe that all the zeros of the zeta function around that line lie exactly on it.

67
00:04:58,914 --> 00:05:01,294
 This is one of the great mysteries in mathematics,

68
00:05:01,474 --> 00:05:04,734
 and people have spent 150-odd years thinking about this.

69
00:05:04,854 --> 00:05:09,334
 And one natural way, if you're given a mystery, is to try to understand,

70
00:05:09,494 --> 00:05:11,494
 well, is this a more general property?

71
00:05:11,654 --> 00:05:15,294
 So are there other functions which look like the Riemann zeta function?

72
00:05:15,754 --> 00:05:19,334
 And maybe by finding lots of those functions and comparing them,

73
00:05:19,334 --> 00:05:23,474
 That tells you the essential properties that make the Riemann hypothesis true.

74
00:05:23,474 --> 00:05:27,854
 Maybe allows you to prove it. So an example would be, you know, if you think

75
00:05:27,854 --> 00:05:31,814
 about evolution, Darwin wanted to sort of establish evidence for evolution, so he

76
00:05:31,814 --> 00:05:35,454
 goes to the Galapagos Islands and he has to find lots of finches that are all

77
00:05:35,454 --> 00:05:39,834
 very similar but not identical, and by making comparisons of the similarities

78
00:05:39,834 --> 00:05:43,494
 and the differences you then understand the essential properties that led them

79
00:05:43,494 --> 00:05:48,894
 to sort of evolve as they did. So we want to find the cousins of the Riemann zeta

80
00:05:48,894 --> 00:05:52,434
 function to see whether there are any. What might you do? Well you might look at

81
00:05:52,434 --> 00:05:55,794
 this sum of the integers and you might change some of these plus signs into

82
00:05:55,794 --> 00:06:01,134
 minus signs and see, well, can you change, have any combination of pluses and

83
00:06:01,134 --> 00:06:05,014
 minuses here and it turns out it's very rare that by changing some of these

84
00:06:05,014 --> 00:06:10,334
 pluses into minuses you can write this sum, the resulting sum, as a product over

85
00:06:10,334 --> 00:06:13,434
 primes that will be slightly different to this product but would resemble it

86
00:06:13,434 --> 00:06:25,628
 and that you have something that had a symmetry line So it very very rare that that happens So here one example of one Let me go back to the Riemann zeta function We going to split the primes up into two classes

87
00:06:26,328 --> 00:06:28,388
 Two will always be special. We'll leave that as it is.

88
00:06:28,808 --> 00:06:33,628
 But the odd primes will either be, if you divide them by 4,

89
00:06:33,968 --> 00:06:36,748
 they'll have either a remainder of 1 or 3.

90
00:06:37,108 --> 00:06:39,048
 So you divide 3 by 4, well, the remainder's 3.

91
00:06:39,348 --> 00:06:43,568
 Divide 5 by 4, the remainder's 1, because 5 is 4 plus 1.

92
00:06:43,568 --> 00:06:55,228
 7, divide that by 4, the remainder is 3. 11 is 3 and 13 is 1. So the ones that are divisible where the remainder is 3 will flip their sign.

93
00:06:55,448 --> 00:07:00,408
 So we put that at a 1 there, we'll put a 1 there, a 1 there and we'll leave the other two.

94
00:07:00,548 --> 00:07:09,928
 Then that gives you an L function which has a symmetry property. If you expand these products out you get a sum over the integers, exactly like the Riemann Zeta function.

95
00:07:09,928 --> 00:07:13,488
 So this is an example of a function which is an L-function.

96
00:07:13,828 --> 00:07:15,948
 A lot of these were discovered in the 19th century.

97
00:07:16,308 --> 00:07:17,628
 There are infinitely many of them.

98
00:07:18,188 --> 00:07:19,288
 You said they were rare.

99
00:07:20,488 --> 00:07:23,468
 Yeah, but despite the fact they're infinitely many,

100
00:07:24,048 --> 00:07:29,568
 they're extremely rare amongst all possible combinations of pluses and minuses that you can have there.

101
00:07:29,708 --> 00:07:33,048
 So we know there are infinitely many other functions that look like the Riemann zeta function.

102
00:07:33,168 --> 00:07:34,848
 You can write them as a sum over the integers.

103
00:07:35,448 --> 00:07:37,368
 You can write them as a product over the primes.

104
00:07:37,368 --> 00:07:40,728
 They have a symmetry line, and we believe they all have a Riemann hypothesis.

105
00:07:41,488 --> 00:07:42,868
 So that was the 19th century.

106
00:07:43,328 --> 00:07:49,388
 Then in the 20th century, people found other examples of functions that have those properties.

107
00:07:49,548 --> 00:07:53,148
 You can write them as sums over the integers or products over the primes.

108
00:07:53,388 --> 00:07:56,488
 They have a symmetry line, and we believe they have a Riemann hypothesis.

109
00:07:56,688 --> 00:07:58,988
 And one of the heroes in this story is Ramanujan.

110
00:07:58,988 --> 00:08:20,448
 So Ramanujan was studying the following function, x times 1 minus x to the power of 24, 1 minus x squared to the power of 24, times 1 minus x cubed to the power of 24, times 1 minus x to the 4 to the power of 24, etc.

111
00:08:20,768 --> 00:08:21,428
 You get the point.

112
00:08:21,428 --> 00:08:26,588
 And what he discovered was that he could write this as a sum of powers of x.

113
00:08:26,588 --> 00:08:31,428
 So it's 1 times x minus 24 times x squared.

114
00:08:31,708 --> 00:08:32,808
 This is something you can do at home.

115
00:08:32,888 --> 00:08:34,228
 You just multiply this thing out.

116
00:08:34,228 --> 00:08:46,608
 Minus 24 times x squared plus 2, 5, 2 times x cubed minus 1, 4, 7, 2 times x to the power of 4, etc.

117
00:08:46,748 --> 00:08:50,188
 This just goes on and you get these beautiful whole numbers coming out.

118
00:08:50,828 --> 00:08:51,568
 Now here's the miracle.

119
00:08:51,828 --> 00:08:54,128
 2 times 3 is 6.

120
00:08:54,128 --> 00:09:03,848
 minus 24 times 252 is minus 6048. So these numbers have the property that for

121
00:09:03,848 --> 00:09:13,648
 example 3 times 5 is 15 and if I go out to the 15th number in this series the

122
00:09:13,648 --> 00:09:21,968
 the the the coefficient there the integer that appears is 252 times 4830.

123
00:09:21,968 --> 00:09:36,523
 This meant you could associate an L function with these things So here what you do You write 1 minus 24 over 2 to the s plus 2 5 2 over 3 to the s

124
00:09:37,583 --> 00:09:41,803
 minus 1 4 7 2 over 4 to the s

125
00:09:42,863 --> 00:09:48,823
 plus 4 8 3 0 over 5 to the s, etc.

126
00:09:48,823 --> 00:09:57,363
 And this series follows from Ramanujan's observation, and a couple more observations that I won't sort of explain in any more detail.

127
00:09:57,563 --> 00:10:03,663
 It follows that you can write this series as a product over primes, just as we did for the Riemann zeta function.

128
00:10:03,663 --> 00:10:10,583
 You can plot that in the complex plane, and it has a symmetry line, exactly like the Riemann zeta function does,

129
00:10:10,763 --> 00:10:15,043
 and the zeros of this function are believed to satisfy a Riemann hypothesis.

130
00:10:15,043 --> 00:10:18,863
 Now these functions are a class of functions called modular forms.

131
00:10:19,123 --> 00:10:27,323
 They have certain symmetry properties which we believe give rise to the kind of general patterns that you see in the Riemann zeta function.

132
00:10:27,463 --> 00:10:31,183
 That is a symmetry line and zeros on that line, a Riemann hypothesis.

133
00:10:31,763 --> 00:10:33,723
 And these were studied throughout the 20th century.

134
00:10:34,383 --> 00:10:42,143
 And Andrew Wiles in his great work on Fermat's last theorem used this connection between modular forms, that is functions like this,

135
00:10:42,143 --> 00:10:47,643
 and L functions, that is functions like this, to prove Fermat's last theorem.

136
00:10:47,823 --> 00:10:51,183
 For all these L functions, we believe there's a Riemann hypothesis.

137
00:10:51,843 --> 00:10:54,563
 So the big goal is to say, well, can we find the patterns?

138
00:10:54,683 --> 00:11:02,203
 Can we see any similarities that would give us a clue as to why the Riemann hypothesis is true for any of them?

139
00:11:03,003 --> 00:11:09,063
 And one of the things that's been done recently is to produce a huge database of millions of these L functions

140
00:11:09,063 --> 00:11:12,823
 with all their properties tabulated in a very clear and simple way.

141
00:11:13,323 --> 00:11:16,343
 And basically the idea is to throw this out to the world and say,

142
00:11:16,683 --> 00:11:18,343
 can you help us find the pattern?

143
00:11:18,823 --> 00:11:21,243
 And what you'll find there is the Riemann zeta function,

144
00:11:21,703 --> 00:11:23,683
 you'll find Ramanujan's L-function,

145
00:11:24,123 --> 00:11:26,603
 you'll find the L-functions that Andrew Wiles studied,

146
00:11:26,903 --> 00:11:29,663
 you'll find even more exotic and weird L-functions

147
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:32,803
 that we believe all have a Riemann hypothesis.

148
00:11:33,703 --> 00:11:36,863
 And if you go to this website, you'll find their zeros,

149
00:11:36,863 --> 00:11:38,823
 you'll find plots of these L-functions,

150
00:11:39,063 --> 00:11:39,903
 What's the pattern?

151
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:42,183
 If I go to this database, though, I'm not going to make a

152
00:11:42,183 --> 00:11:42,883
 breakthrough, am I?

153
00:11:42,883 --> 00:11:45,503
 Surely this is only a resource for mathematicians.

154
00:11:45,503 --> 00:11:49,003
 Well, it's a resource for mathematicians, but I think

155
00:11:49,003 --> 00:11:52,663
 these properties are accessible to a wide

156
00:11:52,663 --> 00:11:53,623
 range of people.

157
00:11:53,623 --> 00:11:56,123
 This database is set up so if you click on any technical

158
00:11:56,123 --> 00:11:58,923
 word, up comes an explanation of that word.

159
00:11:58,923 --> 00:12:01,043
 Now, you probably need to know some mathematics to understand

160
00:12:01,043 --> 00:12:04,023
 that, but looking at the pictures is something that

161
00:12:04,023 --> 00:12:05,063
 anyone can do.

162
00:12:05,063 --> 00:12:07,063
 And somewhere in there, there is a pattern that

163
00:12:07,063 --> 00:12:09,483
 mathematicians haven't spotted.

164
00:12:09,483 --> 00:12:12,383
 So it may well be that somebody else spots it.

165
00:12:12,383 --> 00:12:14,223
 It's not likely, but it is possible.

166
00:12:16,643 --> 00:12:18,983
 Too big.

167
00:12:18,983 --> 00:12:20,963
 There's a little rhyme for this.

168
00:12:20,963 --> 00:12:24,223
 The rhyme is, Shebisev said it, and I'll say it again,

169
00:12:24,223 --> 00:12:26,503
 there's always a prime between n and 2n.

170
00:12:26,503 --> 00:12:29,003
 Riemann did precisely that.

171
00:12:29,003 --> 00:12:32,923
 He explained how to extend this function to all possible

172
00:12:32,923 --> 00:12:34,663
 values, except for one.

173
00:12:34,663 --> 00:12:37,723
 So there's only one value where there's nothing you can do.
