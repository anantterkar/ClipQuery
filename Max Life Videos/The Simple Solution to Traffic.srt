1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,540
 Stuck at an intersection, you always watch unfold the fundamental problem of traffic.

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:12,640
 On green, the first car accelerates, and then the next, and then the next, and then the next, and then you, only to catch the red.

3
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:16,220
 Had the cars accelerated simultaneously, you would have made it through.

4
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:23,960
 Coordination, not cars, is the problem, because we are monkey drivers with slow reaction times and short attention spans.

5
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:30,440
 Even if we tried, getting everyone to press the pedal on 3, 2, 1, now would be challenging.

6
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,040
 This discoordination limits how many cars can get through an intersection,

7
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:40,640
 and when one backs up to the next, that's when city-sized gridlock cascades happen, taking forever to clear.

8
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:44,480
 In general, more intersections equals more discoordination, which equals more traffic.

9
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,700
 This is the motive behind big highways.

10
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:50,400
 No intersections. Splits and merges, yes. Intersections, no.

11
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:53,160
 No stopping, no coordination problems, no traffic.

12
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:57,340
 Well, that's the theory anyway. Intersections outside of a highway will back up onto it,

13
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:02,300
 again, because human reaction times limit how many cars can escape the off-ramp when the light changes.

14
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:12,499
 But even without intersections there would still be traffic on the highway Traffic can just appear Take a one highway with happy cars flowing until a chicken crosses the road

15
00:01:12,599 --> 00:01:13,959
 The driver who sees it brakes a little.

16
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:17,339
 The driver behind him doesn't notice immediately and brakes a little harder than necessary.

17
00:01:17,339 --> 00:01:21,099
 The driver behind him does the same until someone comes to a complete stop.

18
00:01:21,279 --> 00:01:25,319
 And oh look, cars approaching at highway speeds must now stop as well.

19
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:29,799
 Though the chicken is long gone, it left a phantom intersection on the highway.

20
00:01:29,799 --> 00:01:34,619
 This is what's happened when you're stuck in traffic for hours thinking there must be a deadly pile up ahead,

21
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:37,499
 and then suddenly the traffic's over with no wreckage in sight.

22
00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:40,579
 To your relief, if you're a good person, and mild annoyance if you aren't,

23
00:01:40,679 --> 00:01:44,679
 you just pass through a phantom intersection, the cause of which is long gone.

24
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:47,059
 And this phantom intersection moves.

25
00:01:47,239 --> 00:01:53,379
 It's really a traffic snake slithering down the road, eating oncoming cars at one end and pooping them out the other.

26
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:58,719
 On a ring road, a single car slowing down will start an eroporous of traffic that will last forever,

27
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:01,479
 even though there's no problem with the road.

28
00:02:01,479 --> 00:02:05,079
 If the drivers could coordinate to accelerate and separate simultaneously,

29
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:09,219
 easy driving would return, but they can't, so traffic eternal.

30
00:02:09,219 --> 00:02:22,758
 On highways traffic snakes grow if cars are eated faster than excreted and they shrink if excreted faster than eated dying when the last car accelerates away before the next car must stop Now in multi highways there needs be no chicken to start gridlock

31
00:02:22,838 --> 00:02:29,638
 A driver crossing lanes quickly with cars too close behind is enough to birth a traffic snake that lives for hours in leagues.

32
00:02:29,758 --> 00:02:34,758
 It's this quick crossing that causes drivers behind to overbrake and begin a chain reaction.

33
00:02:34,958 --> 00:02:39,418
 But we can make traffic snakes less likely by changing the way we drive.

34
00:02:39,418 --> 00:02:45,098
 Your goal as a driver is to stay the same distance from the car ahead as from the car behind at all times.

35
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:48,358
 Tailgating is trouble, not just because it makes accidents more likely,

36
00:02:48,478 --> 00:02:53,078
 but because you as the tailgater can start a traffic snake if the driver ahead brakes.

37
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:54,758
 Always in the middle.

38
00:02:54,998 --> 00:03:00,518
 This gives you the most time to prevent overbraking, but also gives the driver behind you the most time as well.

39
00:03:00,618 --> 00:03:05,918
 And when stuck in traffic, this rule would get all cars to pull apart the snake faster.

40
00:03:06,318 --> 00:03:08,158
 That's the simple solution to traffic.

41
00:03:08,158 --> 00:03:13,958
 getting humans to change their behavior, perhaps by sharing this video to show how and why traffic happens,

42
00:03:13,958 --> 00:03:29,717
 why tailgaters are trouble and how we can work together to make the roads better for all The end Except yeah wishing upon a star that people are better than they are is a terrible solution every time Instead what works is a structurally systematized solution

43
00:03:29,957 --> 00:03:34,537
 which is exactly what self-driving cars are. Self-driving cars can just be programmed to stay

44
00:03:34,537 --> 00:03:38,577
 in the middle and accelerate simultaneously. They'll just do it. The more self-driving cars

45
00:03:38,577 --> 00:03:43,057
 at an intersection, the more efficient the intersection gets. A solid lane of self-driving

46
00:03:43,057 --> 00:03:48,877
 cars vastly increases throughput. Hmm, actually, if you ban humans from the road, which we should

47
00:03:48,877 --> 00:03:53,197
 totally do anyway, you can get rid of the intersection entirely. After all, a traffic

48
00:03:53,197 --> 00:03:59,057
 light is just a tool for drivers on one road to communicate with drivers on another, poorly and

49
00:03:59,057 --> 00:04:03,697
 coarsely. Red equals don't go now, we are coming through the intersection. Green equals good to go.

50
00:04:03,797 --> 00:04:08,697
 But self-driving cars can talk to each other at the speed of light. With that kind of coordination,

51
00:04:08,697 --> 00:04:14,997
 no traffic light necessary. Just as with a highway, the best intersection is no intersection. Humans

52
00:04:14,997 --> 00:04:19,457
 will never drive this precisely. At the intersection, the fundamental problem with

53
00:04:19,457 --> 00:04:24,997
 traffic that you watch unfold, as with everything, is people. So the real simple solution to traffic

54
00:04:24,997 --> 00:04:27,257
 is no more monkeys driving cars.
