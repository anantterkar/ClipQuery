1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
 Most processes in our universe are time-reversible.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,500
 In other words, the physics works the same way forwards or backwards.

3
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:11,500
 Which is why you can't tell if I'm playing these videos normally or in reverse.

4
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:15,500
 People typically point to entropy as the only exception to this rule.

5
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:19,500
 The second law of thermodynamics states that the entropy of a system,

6
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:23,500
 or the amount of disorder, always increases with time.

7
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:27,500
 But increasing entropy is an emergent property,

8
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:30,400
 The result of the motions of many, many particles.

9
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:35,420
 Which raises the question, can fundamental particles themselves tell the direction of

10
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:36,420
 time?

11
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:40,320
 Or in other words, is there a physical process on the scale of individual particles that

12
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,540
 looks different forwards vs. backwards?

13
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:46,920
 The answer, surprisingly, is yes.

14
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:50,560
 In particle physics, there are three major symmetries that we're always expected to

15
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:51,560
 hold.

16
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:54,180
 Charge, parity, and time.

17
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:58,200
 Time symmetry, as we've already discussed, means interactions work the same way forwards

18
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,320
 or backwards in time.

19
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,720
 Charge symmetry means interactions are unaffected if all the charges are swapped.

20
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:08,600
 In other words, there is nothing special about what we call positive charge.

21
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:12,760
 Nature treats it exactly equal and opposite to negative charge.

22
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:18,380
 And parity symmetry means the laws of physics are indifferent to left or right handedness.

23
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:23,340
 Now to understand what that means, imagine a giant mirror were held up to our universe.

24
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:30,180
 And in the mirror, the z-direction is reversed and my right hand becomes my left hand, but

25
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:32,460
 the laws of physics shouldn't care.

26
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:36,140
 I mean, they should work exactly the same way in the mirror world as they do in the

27
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:39,940
 regular one, with no preference for left or right handedness.

28
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:43,760
 Or to put it another way, there should be no experiment that you could do that would

29
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:47,500
 tell you whether or not you are in the mirror world.

30
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:51,860
 Each of these symmetries is known by its initials, C, P, and T.

31
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:56,240
 In the 1950s, it was thought that all fundamental particles obey these symmetries.

32
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:01,480
 But then in 1956, a paper written by Li and Yang pointed out that parity symmetry had

33
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:05,240
 actually never been tested in experiments involving the weak force.

34
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:20,376
 So at Christmas break that year physics professor Xianxian Wu of Columbia University had planned to go on vacation with her husband who was also a physicist but instead so intrigued by the possibility that the weak force might violate parity she decided to stay behind and

35
00:02:20,376 --> 00:02:26,056
 be the first person to test it. To do this, she and a team of low-temperature scientists cooled

36
00:02:26,056 --> 00:02:31,756
 a collection of cobalt-60 atoms to just three thousandth of a degree above absolute zero.

37
00:02:32,396 --> 00:02:36,956
 Then they applied a strong magnetic field to align all the nuclei with their spin pointing

38
00:02:36,956 --> 00:02:42,676
 in the same direction. Now, cobalt-60 is radioactive, and it decays via the weak nuclear force releasing

39
00:02:42,676 --> 00:02:47,676
 a beta particle, which is just an electron. And what the experiment measured was the direction

40
00:02:47,676 --> 00:02:53,396
 in which these electrons were emitted relative to the spin of the cobalt-60 nuclei. To see how this

41
00:02:53,396 --> 00:02:58,096
 would work under parity symmetry, let's consider the mirror image version of this experiment.

42
00:02:58,636 --> 00:03:03,736
 In the mirror, the direction of the z-axis is flipped, but the direction of nuclear spin is not.

43
00:03:03,736 --> 00:03:08,976
 That's because an object that's rotating clockwise is still rotating clockwise in the mirror.

44
00:03:09,256 --> 00:03:14,096
 So, this means that the spins of the regular and mirror nuclei are aligned.

45
00:03:14,116 --> 00:03:17,876
 The mirror experiment is actually the same experiment as the original.

46
00:03:18,016 --> 00:03:24,156
 Now, when a cobalt-60 nucleus decays and emits an electron, that electron could go, say, to the left or to the right.

47
00:03:24,496 --> 00:03:29,356
 Now, if parity symmetry is respected, the electron should be equally likely to go in any direction.

48
00:03:29,356 --> 00:03:34,536
 direction. That way both the normal and mirror image experiments would give the same results.

49
00:03:34,536 --> 00:03:38,796
 However if the electrons were emitted in one direction preferentially, say in the positive

50
00:03:38,796 --> 00:03:43,776
 z direction, well then in the mirror experiment the electrons would also have to fly off preferentially

51
00:03:43,776 --> 00:03:49,196
 in the mirror positive z direction, which is opposite to the original positive z direction.

52
00:03:49,196 --> 00:03:52,556
 So in the normal experiment the electrons would be emitted say opposite the direction

53
00:03:52,556 --> 00:03:56,536
 of nuclear spin, but in the mirror version they'd be emitted in the same direction as

54
00:03:56,536 --> 00:04:01,516
 nuclear spin. So how does this make any sense? It would allow you to determine whether you're

55
00:04:01,516 --> 00:04:06,476
 in the mirror world or not. It's like the spinning top from Inception. If the electrons

56
00:04:06,476 --> 00:04:10,296
 from the cobalt-60 nuclei go one way, you're in mirror world, and if they go the other

57
00:04:10,296 --> 00:04:16,096
 way, you know you're in normal world. Now crazy as this may seem, this is exactly what

58
00:04:16,096 --> 00:04:22,396
 Professor Wu saw. Electrons were emitted preferentially in one direction, and not just by a little

59
00:04:22,396 --> 00:04:36,173
 They were predominantly emitted opposite nuclear spin So not only does the weak force violate parity it comes close to violating parity as much as is physically possible This destroyed a basic assumption of theoretical physics that

60
00:04:36,173 --> 00:04:42,793
 had been around for decades. Somehow the universe cares about left or right-handedness. When Wu

61
00:04:42,793 --> 00:04:48,953
 announced her results, they shocked the physics world. After being told of the experiment, famous

62
00:04:48,953 --> 00:04:55,113
 physicist and Nobel laureate Wolfgang Pauli said, that's total nonsense, and insisted the result was

63
00:04:55,113 --> 00:05:00,393
 mistaken. When the experiment was independently replicated, theoretical physicists had to accept

64
00:05:00,393 --> 00:05:05,953
 that the universe we live in is not the one they had imagined. The Nobel Prize was actually awarded

65
00:05:05,953 --> 00:05:11,893
 for the discovery of parity violation in 1957, the very same year these results were published.

66
00:05:12,373 --> 00:05:17,733
 This required a profound shift in thinking for physicists, but before throwing everything out

67
00:05:17,733 --> 00:05:21,453
 and starting again from scratch, they formulated a workaround.

68
00:05:21,453 --> 00:05:24,793
 Maybe it was OK that the weak force broke parity,

69
00:05:24,793 --> 00:05:27,833
 because it's not a real symmetry of the universe itself,

70
00:05:27,833 --> 00:05:32,733
 just part of a larger symmetry, charge parity, or CP symmetry.

71
00:05:32,733 --> 00:05:36,173
 The idea was if the mirror flipped not only these axes,

72
00:05:36,173 --> 00:05:39,193
 but it also swapped the particles for antiparticles

73
00:05:39,193 --> 00:05:41,673
 with their charges reversed, well, then the symmetry

74
00:05:41,673 --> 00:05:43,413
 would be restored, and the mathematics

75
00:05:43,413 --> 00:05:45,673
 behind our laws of physics would still work.

76
00:05:45,673 --> 00:05:47,673
 Now, this gave physicists some comfort.

77
00:05:47,673 --> 00:05:54,633
 until in 1964 it was found that some particles can also violate the combined charge parity symmetry.

78
00:05:54,633 --> 00:05:58,173
 And boom! You got yourself another Nobel Prize.

79
00:05:58,173 --> 00:06:02,913
 Now two rules which physicists once thought were fundamental laws of nature were broken.

80
00:06:02,913 --> 00:06:06,873
 So they retreated behind their last set of theoretical defenses,

81
00:06:06,873 --> 00:06:10,773
 the combined symmetry of CPT, where T is time.

82
00:06:10,773 --> 00:06:15,173
 Sure, they said, the weak force violates parity and charge parity,

83
00:06:15,173 --> 00:06:18,613
 but certainly not charge, parity, and time together.

84
00:06:18,613 --> 00:06:23,653
 And to this day, physicists are still pretty sure that CPT is a real symmetry of the universe.

85
00:06:23,653 --> 00:06:27,573
 So far, no experiment has found a violation of CPT.

86
00:06:27,573 --> 00:06:32,773
 In fact, if CPT is violated, we would have to rewrite a lot of the last century's work,

87
00:06:32,773 --> 00:06:37,493
 because it would mean that special relativity and quantum field theory are both wrong.

88
00:06:37,493 --> 00:06:51,209
 Okay so let say that CPT is a true symmetry Think about the implications of this If we know that CP can be violated but CPT cannot then time symmetry must also be broken Otherwise there would be no way for the combined

89
00:06:51,209 --> 00:06:57,269
 three-way symmetry to be maintained while two of the subsymmetries are broken. And physicists have

90
00:06:57,269 --> 00:07:02,609
 actually conducted experiments that confirm that certain particles directly break time symmetry.

91
00:07:03,009 --> 00:07:07,509
 For example, when a pair of quarks are held together by the strong force, there are sometimes

92
00:07:07,509 --> 00:07:14,129
 two different possible arrangements, and they can switch back and forth between these two arrangements via the weak force.

93
00:07:14,129 --> 00:07:17,029
 But switching in one direction takes longer than switching back.

94
00:07:17,349 --> 00:07:23,849
 So if you could make a recording of this event, it would look different if you played the recording forwards than if you played it backwards.

95
00:07:23,849 --> 00:07:28,909
 And that's exactly what it means to break time symmetry. In certain cases then,

96
00:07:29,389 --> 00:07:33,929
 fundamental particles can tell the difference between going forwards and backwards in time.

97
00:07:33,929 --> 00:07:38,609
 The second law of thermodynamics is not the only physical process that prefers

98
00:07:38,609 --> 00:07:43,809
 one direction in time. Now is this the origin of our perception that time only

99
00:07:43,809 --> 00:07:49,409
 goes one way or is it the reason for the universe's arrow of time? The truth is

100
00:07:49,409 --> 00:07:54,249
 that we still have no idea why time only goes in one direction. What's interesting

101
00:07:54,249 --> 00:07:58,429
 is that physicists once thought that parity, charge, and time were these

102
00:07:58,429 --> 00:08:02,529
 symmetries that were unbreakable. But over time each of these symmetries was

103
00:08:02,529 --> 00:08:08,949
 demonstrably violated. So is the ultimate symmetry CPT also unbreakable? Or will it

104
00:08:08,949 --> 00:08:13,149
 fall taking quantum field theory and special relativity with it? These are

105
00:08:13,149 --> 00:08:17,709
 just some of the big basic unresolved mysteries left in our quest to

106
00:08:17,709 --> 00:08:21,729
 understand the universe. Perhaps one day another physicist will give up their

107
00:08:21,729 --> 00:08:23,849
 vacation to figure out the answer.

108
00:08:27,289 --> 00:08:31,149
 This episode of Veritasium was animated and co-written by my friend Jorge Cham,

109
00:08:31,149 --> 00:08:35,149
 who is also the creator of PhD Comics, and now he's written a book.

110
00:08:35,149 --> 00:08:36,649
 Yeah, it's called We Have No Idea.

111
00:08:36,649 --> 00:08:39,149
 It's a book I wrote with physicist Daniel Whiteson,

112
00:08:39,149 --> 00:08:41,649
 and it's about all the things we don't know about the universe.

113
00:08:41,649 --> 00:08:44,649
 All of the big things like dark matter and dark energy,

114
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:48,149
 but also all the little things like what are all those fundamental particles for?

115
00:08:48,149 --> 00:08:49,649
 And it has cartoons in it.

116
00:08:49,649 --> 00:08:52,149
 Yep, and lots of bad puns.

117
00:08:52,149 --> 00:08:54,649
 So if that sounds like it's up your alley, you should check it out.

118
00:08:54,649 --> 00:08:58,649
 I'll put a link to it in the description and all of Jorge's other projects.

119
00:08:58,649 --> 00:08:59,649
 Thanks.
