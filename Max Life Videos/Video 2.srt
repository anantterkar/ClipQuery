 Hello friends, so today I am here to talk about the latest fund that we have launched.

2
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:17,900
 I am talking about Sustainable Wealth 50. Why this is such a special fund, I am going

3
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:23,900
 to talk about it in next 2 minutes. We see the markets are volatile, that's the basic

4
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:29,140
 nature of the market. Now what are those companies, which are those companies which keep striving

5
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:35,340
 even when the markets are volatile. We did our research on it and we found out the companies

6
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:39,900
 which are self reliant, the companies which have very strong balance sheet, the companies

7
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:44,180
 basically which are atanirbhar, what does that mean? Companies which have high cash

8
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:50,740
 inflow, which have deep pockets, these are the companies which keep standing tall even

9
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:55,860
 when there is a volatility in the market. We selected those 50 companies from the Nifty

10
00:00:56,180 --> 00:01:02,500
 500 universe and we formed this fund that we call Sustainable Wealth 50. What has been

11
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:07,180
 the track record of these 50 companies? I will tell you. Last 10 years as you can see

12
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:13,420
 on your screens, the returns have been as high as 25%, whereas you can see the returns

13
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:21,180
 from Nifty 50 and Nifty 500 universe as well. Last 3 years, last 1 year, last 5 years, these

14
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:26,660
 companies have always outperformed, not only outperformed, they have given a better and

15
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:32,980
 a double CAGR than what the benchmark has been giving. Now this fund is available in

16
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:38,380
 our star product in both the variants, Life Secure and 3D. Let's go all out, educate our

17
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:40,380
