[0.00 - 12.60]  Hello friends, so today I am here to talk about the latest fund that we have launched.
[12.60 - 17.90]  I am talking about Sustainable Wealth 50. Why this is such a special fund, I am going
[17.90 - 23.90]  to talk about it in next 2 minutes. We see the markets are volatile, that's the basic
[23.90 - 29.14]  nature of the market. Now what are those companies, which are those companies which keep striving
[29.14 - 35.34]  even when the markets are volatile. We did our research on it and we found out the companies
[35.34 - 39.90]  which are self reliant, the companies which have very strong balance sheet, the companies
[39.90 - 44.18]  basically which are aatmnirbhar, what does that mean? Companies which have high cash
[44.18 - 50.74]  inflow, which have deep pockets, these are the companies which keep standing tall even
[50.74 - 55.86]  when there is a volatility in the market. We selected those 50 companies from the Nifty
[56.18 - 62.50]  500 universe and we formed this fund that we call Sustainable Wealth 50. What has been
[62.50 - 67.18]  the track record of these 50 companies? I will tell you. Last 10 years as you can see
[67.18 - 73.42]  on your screens, the returns have been as high as 25%, whereas you can see the returns
[73.42 - 81.18]  from Nifty 50 and Nifty 500 universe as well. Last 3 years, last 1 year, last 5 years, these
[81.26 - 86.66]  companies have always outperformed, not only outperformed, they have given a better and
[86.66 - 92.98]  a double CAGR than what the benchmark has been giving. Now this fund is available in
[92.98 - 98.38]  our star product in both the variants, Life Secure and 3D. Let's go all out, educate our
[98.38 - 100.38]  customers, happy selling. Thank you.
