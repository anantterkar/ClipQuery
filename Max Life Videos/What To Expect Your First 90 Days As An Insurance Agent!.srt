1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,540
 I've been thinking about what video should we shoot?

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:04,340
 And this one's all about what to expect

3
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:05,940
 your first 90 days as an agent,

4
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:07,940
 because I really believe that if you're thinking

5
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:08,660
 about getting in the industry,

6
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,020
 or if you're currently in it, or you're in your 90 days,

7
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:13,100
 or you're after your 90 days, and you can relate to this,

8
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:14,900
 that a lot of people are getting in the industry.

9
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:17,140
 They're thinking it's gonna be a cakewalk.

10
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:18,640
 They're getting sold the dream.

11
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:20,380
 Some MLM recruiters are like,

12
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:21,720
 dude, this is freaking phenomenal.

13
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:22,940
 You're gonna make so much money.

14
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:24,240
 Oh my gosh, it's insane.

15
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:26,460
 I'm here to tell you, it is difficult.

16
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:27,840
 It is not easy.

17
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:29,580
 Now, it can be easy, okay?

18
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:35,180
 But if I just say, dude, this industry is easy, like I'm lying because 92% of insurance agents fell.

19
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:44,500
 Even when I got out and made $117,000, my first full month, $117,000 my first eight months, it still wasn't easy because I had to work my butt off.

20
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:49,100
 So I'm going to kind of go through like the psychology of how you can succeed your first 90 days.

21
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:52,200
 Also, too, though, I want you thinking about like as an example.

22
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:58,460
 a lot of people get in the industry and they become really overwhelmed by all of the

23
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:05,440
 companies available right all the carriers all the different products all different commission

24
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:11,220
 levels all the different ways to get in front of people all different terminology right and

25
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:16,820
 different product specifics and the ins and outs of like all the writers and benefits and all the

26
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:21,060
 stuff that like maybe you didn't maybe wasn't on your test and it's funny when you take your

27
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:27,140
 insurance test, you end up using very little full transparency, shoot the messenger, freaking

28
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:32,720
 obliterate me in comments. If I'm wrong, you end up using very little of what you studied for,

29
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:37,840
 what you memorized and what you took a test on. You know what I mean? Like they're not like,

30
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:42,380
 you know, all this money laundering stuff. Yeah, it's good. Freaking don't, you know,

31
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:47,480
 launder money, dude. People know that like that's, that's a common sense, right? But you don't end

32
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:50,880
 up encountering that a lot as an agent, you know? And if you're out there like, dude, I

33
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,140
 I encounter that all the time.

34
00:01:52,140 --> 00:02:09,245
 People are constantly wanting to launder money with me and put it in life policies and then take it out and scam people and I like this is not true Okay So a lot of this stuff that you studying for you don end up using but here one thing I can tell you this the people that succeed the best in the first 90 days

35
00:02:09,385 --> 00:02:17,105
 the first 180 days, the first 365 days, first two and three years, they become less worried

36
00:02:17,105 --> 00:02:23,085
 about all of the intricate details. Because what happens is you get analysis paralysis.

37
00:02:23,085 --> 00:02:27,965
 you want to know everything before you do anything. And I can tell you what,

38
00:02:28,345 --> 00:02:32,045
 if that, if you're being honest with yourself and you have that personality style,

39
00:02:32,585 --> 00:02:37,545
 and a lot of people do, I'm not saying you can't succeed in insurance, but I am saying it's going

40
00:02:37,545 --> 00:02:41,985
 to be more difficult because you're going to want to know stuff before you do stuff.

41
00:02:42,225 --> 00:02:48,925
 And the answer for succeeding in insurance is just getting in front of people. It's just activity.

42
00:02:48,925 --> 00:02:55,585
 it's just doing more and I'm just keeping it real when I say that right so we talk through being

43
00:02:55,585 --> 00:03:04,165
 overwhelmed that's common happens to a lot of people we get really like foggy and we want we

44
00:03:04,165 --> 00:03:10,285
 like it we get paralyzed because we don't know what to do we're like well crap I want to make

45
00:03:10,285 --> 00:03:18,525
 calls Cody I want to make calls man but what if they say how much does it cost what if they say

46
00:03:18,525 --> 00:03:25,905
 how long have you been selling insurance what if they say i'm not interested it's like really

47
00:03:25,905 --> 00:03:32,765
 what's funny is we think you think a lot of people think maybe not you i don't know think

48
00:03:32,765 --> 00:03:36,865
 that you need to know the specifics you've got to understand all the intricate details

49
00:03:36,865 --> 00:03:43,025
 and that you need this like perfect phrasing and this super secret ninja phrase like a lot more of

50
00:03:43,025 --> 00:03:47,385
 this is to this business is is a lot more than just sales training by the way right like yeah

51
00:03:47,385 --> 00:03:48,465
 That's important.

52
00:03:48,465 --> 00:03:49,785
 My book, Zero to Six Figures,

53
00:03:49,785 --> 00:03:52,705
 talks a lot about sales training you can get at Amazon.

54
00:03:52,705 --> 00:04:09,231
 But it a lot more than just sales training Like as an example finding the right company to work with is super important because I believe in niching down I believe in learning a product I believe in mastering

55
00:04:09,231 --> 00:04:14,191
 and becoming an expert at something at some point, but also believe in doing a lot and getting in

56
00:04:14,191 --> 00:04:17,611
 front of people. And so if you're ever like, man, I don't know if I'm at the right home.

57
00:04:18,311 --> 00:04:22,691
 I'm thinking about leaving the industry. I want a new agency to work with. I want to meet some

58
00:04:22,691 --> 00:04:26,251
 other people in the space that Cody, that you trust, because I get a lot of questions, man,

59
00:04:26,271 --> 00:04:31,331
 who should I work with? Whatever. We have a new program available. You can go to agentplacementprogram.com.

60
00:04:31,491 --> 00:04:38,191
 The link's in the description below already by default. And you can click on that and go and

61
00:04:38,191 --> 00:04:44,411
 read more, watch the video, put your information in, and then we can refer you to an agency to

62
00:04:44,411 --> 00:04:49,431
 work with, right? Like I'm not personally recruiting for me, but I am trying to play

63
00:04:49,431 --> 00:04:55,091
 matchmaker and help agents and agencies and keep you from leaving because I don't want you to leave.

64
00:04:55,471 --> 00:04:59,131
 Okay. Right. But the people that, that want to analyze everything are going to have a little

65
00:04:59,131 --> 00:05:03,811
 tougher because you just need to know that you feel like you need to know stuff. Right. But the

66
00:05:03,811 --> 00:05:08,231
 people that are just, that just go at this thing and focus on getting in front of people and winning

67
00:05:08,231 --> 00:05:14,911
 and doing the activity. And if a mentor or a coach tells you to do something, now, if they tell you

68
00:05:14,911 --> 00:05:19,251
 something that tell you to do something, but I'm telling you to do the opposite, dude,

69
00:05:19,971 --> 00:05:25,671
 that's a tough, that's a tough scenario because if they believe something, but I believe something,

70
00:05:26,031 --> 00:05:29,851
 you know what I mean? That's tough. If you're working with them every day in their office,

71
00:05:30,891 --> 00:05:36,351
 dude, try whatever they're saying. If it doesn't work, do it my way. Probably work, right? But

72
00:05:36,351 --> 00:05:41,631
 you've got to take action no matter what. Okay. Second thing is the niche. Yes, you can be

73
00:05:41,631 --> 00:05:45,291
 overwhelmed, but then you got to pick a niche, man. Like you've got to get really good at owning

74
00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:52,011
 a lane. I sold life insurance my first year and I did it by cold calling and cold door knocking

75
00:05:52,011 --> 00:06:04,696
 people that were between the ages of 50 and 85 I just did about burial and final expenses and all that kind of stuff Right And it was through it was it was cold calling cold door knocking It was um I used to have call nights

76
00:06:04,696 --> 00:06:11,996
 at the office and I bring people in. We also used to do, um, uh, work the warm market. I didn't work

77
00:06:11,996 --> 00:06:16,596
 a lot of leads, you know, my first couple of years, full transparency. I did not. I saw the

78
00:06:16,596 --> 00:06:21,516
 benefits of doing that at some point and just hadn't yet. Right. But the second is, is the

79
00:06:21,516 --> 00:06:25,056
 niche. You need to own a niche because you can get good at, you can learn a lot in a niche.

80
00:06:25,236 --> 00:06:29,556
 You can say the same things over and over again. You can get in a cycle and a consistency and a

81
00:06:29,556 --> 00:06:33,196
 rhythm so that you can start making money every week. I was talking to someone earlier and they're

82
00:06:33,196 --> 00:06:38,356
 like, man, I've made like five grand so far these first several months. I'm like,

83
00:06:39,116 --> 00:06:43,236
 you should be thinking, dude, how do I do what I did, but do it in a week,

84
00:06:43,656 --> 00:06:47,196
 every week, how to make five grand, which leads me to the next piece, which is prospecting.

85
00:06:47,196 --> 00:06:51,696
 this is the part that is overlooked the most because you think i need product knowledge

86
00:06:51,696 --> 00:06:57,676
 you think i gotta know everything about the carriers you think dude i got no sales and

87
00:06:57,676 --> 00:07:01,656
 closing and if they say you know this stuff it's like dude none of these other things matter

88
00:07:01,656 --> 00:07:07,696
 if you cannot get in front of someone i believe in getting in front of at least 10 people and

89
00:07:07,696 --> 00:07:10,836
 you can do that part-time by the way i got in front of 10 people a week part-time

90
00:07:10,836 --> 00:07:16,696
 you got to get in front of 10 people every single week to succeed in this business and if you're not

91
00:07:16,696 --> 00:07:23,056
 asking 10 people minimum to do business with you, you will 1000% fail. And so I want to get these

92
00:07:23,056 --> 00:07:29,056
 90 days started off right. This is what you can expect. Your first 90 days as an agent,

93
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:35,596
 you can succeed. You can have a ton of fun. Most don't. Most do not do well. Most do not make a

94
00:07:35,596 --> 00:07:41,596
 bunch of money, but that doesn't mean you can't. Welcome back to the CA Power Players Podcast.

95
00:07:41,596 --> 00:07:46,396
 We've had the Mr. David Dufour back in Springfield Mo in the studio.

96
00:07:46,636 --> 00:07:47,516
 Dave, welcome back.

97
00:07:47,636 --> 00:07:48,736
 Greetings and salutations.

98
00:07:49,056 --> 00:07:49,196
 Dude.

99
00:07:49,536 --> 00:07:51,136
 I love spending time with you, man.

100
00:07:51,196 --> 00:07:51,736
 Well, thank you.

101
00:07:51,896 --> 00:07:52,276
 I do too.

102
00:07:52,296 --> 00:07:52,716
 I really do.

103
00:07:52,736 --> 00:07:53,236
 It's fun.

104
00:07:53,536 --> 00:07:54,596
 You're such a great host.

105
00:07:55,256 --> 00:07:58,396
 We've had such a nice time at Chipotle a couple times.

106
00:07:58,556 --> 00:07:58,976
 Yeah, man.
