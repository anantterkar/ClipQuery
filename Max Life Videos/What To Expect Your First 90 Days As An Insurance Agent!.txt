[0.00 - 2.54]  I've been thinking about what video should we shoot?
[3.18 - 4.34]  And this one's all about what to expect
[4.34 - 5.94]  your first 90 days as an agent,
[5.94 - 7.94]  because I really believe that if you're thinking
[7.94 - 8.66]  about getting in the industry,
[8.88 - 11.02]  or if you're currently in it, or you're in your 90 days,
[11.08 - 13.10]  or you're after your 90 days, and you can relate to this,
[13.44 - 14.90]  that a lot of people are getting in the industry.
[15.88 - 17.14]  They're thinking it's gonna be a cakewalk.
[17.48 - 18.64]  They're getting sold the dream.
[19.08 - 20.38]  Some MLM recruiters are like,
[20.44 - 21.72]  dude, this is freaking phenomenal.
[21.90 - 22.94]  You're gonna make so much money.
[23.02 - 24.24]  Oh my gosh, it's insane.
[24.66 - 26.46]  I'm here to tell you, it is difficult.
[26.88 - 27.84]  It is not easy.
[27.98 - 29.58]  Now, it can be easy, okay?
[29.58 - 35.18]  But if I just say, dude, this industry is easy, like I'm lying because 92% of insurance agents fell.
[35.40 - 44.50]  Even when I got out and made $117,000, my first full month, $117,000 my first eight months, it still wasn't easy because I had to work my butt off.
[44.68 - 49.10]  So I'm going to kind of go through like the psychology of how you can succeed your first 90 days.
[49.54 - 52.20]  Also, too, though, I want you thinking about like as an example.
[52.20 - 58.46]  a lot of people get in the industry and they become really overwhelmed by all of the
[58.46 - 65.44]  companies available right all the carriers all the different products all different commission
[65.44 - 71.22]  levels all the different ways to get in front of people all different terminology right and
[71.22 - 76.82]  different product specifics and the ins and outs of like all the writers and benefits and all the
[76.82 - 81.06]  stuff that like maybe you didn't maybe wasn't on your test and it's funny when you take your
[81.06 - 87.14]  insurance test, you end up using very little full transparency, shoot the messenger, freaking
[87.14 - 92.72]  obliterate me in comments. If I'm wrong, you end up using very little of what you studied for,
[92.80 - 97.84]  what you memorized and what you took a test on. You know what I mean? Like they're not like,
[97.84 - 102.38]  you know, all this money laundering stuff. Yeah, it's good. Freaking don't, you know,
[102.44 - 107.48]  launder money, dude. People know that like that's, that's a common sense, right? But you don't end
[107.48 - 110.88]  up encountering that a lot as an agent, you know? And if you're out there like, dude, I
[110.88 - 112.14]  I encounter that all the time.
[112.14 - 129.25]  People are constantly wanting to launder money with me and put it in life policies and then take it out and scam people and I like this is not true Okay So a lot of this stuff that you studying for you don end up using but here one thing I can tell you this the people that succeed the best in the first 90 days
[129.39 - 137.11]  the first 180 days, the first 365 days, first two and three years, they become less worried
[137.11 - 143.09]  about all of the intricate details. Because what happens is you get analysis paralysis.
[143.09 - 147.97]  you want to know everything before you do anything. And I can tell you what,
[148.35 - 152.05]  if that, if you're being honest with yourself and you have that personality style,
[152.59 - 157.55]  and a lot of people do, I'm not saying you can't succeed in insurance, but I am saying it's going
[157.55 - 161.99]  to be more difficult because you're going to want to know stuff before you do stuff.
[162.23 - 168.93]  And the answer for succeeding in insurance is just getting in front of people. It's just activity.
[168.93 - 175.59]  it's just doing more and I'm just keeping it real when I say that right so we talk through being
[175.59 - 184.17]  overwhelmed that's common happens to a lot of people we get really like foggy and we want we
[184.17 - 190.29]  like it we get paralyzed because we don't know what to do we're like well crap I want to make
[190.29 - 198.53]  calls Cody I want to make calls man but what if they say how much does it cost what if they say
[198.53 - 205.91]  how long have you been selling insurance what if they say i'm not interested it's like really
[205.91 - 212.77]  what's funny is we think you think a lot of people think maybe not you i don't know think
[212.77 - 216.87]  that you need to know the specifics you've got to understand all the intricate details
[216.87 - 223.03]  and that you need this like perfect phrasing and this super secret ninja phrase like a lot more of
[223.03 - 227.39]  this is to this business is is a lot more than just sales training by the way right like yeah
[227.39 - 228.47]  That's important.
[228.47 - 229.79]  My book, Zero to Six Figures,
[229.79 - 232.71]  talks a lot about sales training you can get at Amazon.
[232.71 - 249.23]  But it a lot more than just sales training Like as an example finding the right company to work with is super important because I believe in niching down I believe in learning a product I believe in mastering
[249.23 - 254.19]  and becoming an expert at something at some point, but also believe in doing a lot and getting in
[254.19 - 257.61]  front of people. And so if you're ever like, man, I don't know if I'm at the right home.
[258.31 - 262.69]  I'm thinking about leaving the industry. I want a new agency to work with. I want to meet some
[262.69 - 266.25]  other people in the space that Cody, that you trust, because I get a lot of questions, man,
[266.27 - 271.33]  who should I work with? Whatever. We have a new program available. You can go to agentplacementprogram.com.
[271.49 - 278.19]  The link's in the description below already by default. And you can click on that and go and
[278.19 - 284.41]  read more, watch the video, put your information in, and then we can refer you to an agency to
[284.41 - 289.43]  work with, right? Like I'm not personally recruiting for me, but I am trying to play
[289.43 - 295.09]  matchmaker and help agents and agencies and keep you from leaving because I don't want you to leave.
[295.47 - 299.13]  Okay. Right. But the people that, that want to analyze everything are going to have a little
[299.13 - 303.81]  tougher because you just need to know that you feel like you need to know stuff. Right. But the
[303.81 - 308.23]  people that are just, that just go at this thing and focus on getting in front of people and winning
[308.23 - 314.91]  and doing the activity. And if a mentor or a coach tells you to do something, now, if they tell you
[314.91 - 319.25]  something that tell you to do something, but I'm telling you to do the opposite, dude,
[319.97 - 325.67]  that's a tough, that's a tough scenario because if they believe something, but I believe something,
[326.03 - 329.85]  you know what I mean? That's tough. If you're working with them every day in their office,
[330.89 - 336.35]  dude, try whatever they're saying. If it doesn't work, do it my way. Probably work, right? But
[336.35 - 341.63]  you've got to take action no matter what. Okay. Second thing is the niche. Yes, you can be
[341.63 - 345.29]  overwhelmed, but then you got to pick a niche, man. Like you've got to get really good at owning
[345.29 - 352.01]  a lane. I sold life insurance my first year and I did it by cold calling and cold door knocking
[352.01 - 364.70]  people that were between the ages of 50 and 85 I just did about burial and final expenses and all that kind of stuff Right And it was through it was it was cold calling cold door knocking It was um I used to have call nights
[364.70 - 372.00]  at the office and I bring people in. We also used to do, um, uh, work the warm market. I didn't work
[372.00 - 376.60]  a lot of leads, you know, my first couple of years, full transparency. I did not. I saw the
[376.60 - 381.52]  benefits of doing that at some point and just hadn't yet. Right. But the second is, is the
[381.52 - 385.06]  niche. You need to own a niche because you can get good at, you can learn a lot in a niche.
[385.24 - 389.56]  You can say the same things over and over again. You can get in a cycle and a consistency and a
[389.56 - 393.20]  rhythm so that you can start making money every week. I was talking to someone earlier and they're
[393.20 - 398.36]  like, man, I've made like five grand so far these first several months. I'm like,
[399.12 - 403.24]  you should be thinking, dude, how do I do what I did, but do it in a week,
[403.66 - 407.20]  every week, how to make five grand, which leads me to the next piece, which is prospecting.
[407.20 - 411.70]  this is the part that is overlooked the most because you think i need product knowledge
[411.70 - 417.68]  you think i gotta know everything about the carriers you think dude i got no sales and
[417.68 - 421.66]  closing and if they say you know this stuff it's like dude none of these other things matter
[421.66 - 427.70]  if you cannot get in front of someone i believe in getting in front of at least 10 people and
[427.70 - 430.84]  you can do that part-time by the way i got in front of 10 people a week part-time
[430.84 - 436.70]  you got to get in front of 10 people every single week to succeed in this business and if you're not
[436.70 - 443.06]  asking 10 people minimum to do business with you, you will 1000% fail. And so I want to get these
[443.06 - 449.06]  90 days started off right. This is what you can expect. Your first 90 days as an agent,
[449.42 - 455.60]  you can succeed. You can have a ton of fun. Most don't. Most do not do well. Most do not make a
[455.60 - 461.60]  bunch of money, but that doesn't mean you can't. Welcome back to the CA Power Players Podcast.
[461.60 - 466.40]  We've had the Mr. David Dufour back in Springfield Mo in the studio.
[466.64 - 467.52]  Dave, welcome back.
