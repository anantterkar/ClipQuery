 Part of this video was sponsored by LastPass.

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:04,660
 Stick around to the end for a word from our sponsor.

3
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:10,720
 In a recent study, participants were placed in a room for between 6 and 15 minutes.

4
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:15,480
 They were given nothing except a button that they knew would shock them if they pressed it.

5
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:18,840
 They were asked to entertain themselves with their thoughts,

6
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:22,960
 but they could self-administer the shock if they so chose.

7
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:24,740
 So, what happened?

8
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:32,700
 Well, 25% of women and 67% of men shocked themselves.

9
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:36,920
 This is despite the fact that they had previously told the experimenters that they would pay

10
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:39,420
 money to avoid the shock.

11
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:44,420
 Apparently they'd rather experience physical pain than just be bored, to have nothing to

12
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:47,500
 keep them occupied but their thoughts.

13
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,720
 But they are not alone.

14
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:55,540
 Around 95% of American adults report participating in some leisure activities over the past 24

15
00:00:55,540 --> 00:01:02,960
 hours, but only 17% say they spent any time at all just relaxing and thinking.

16
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,160
 Because that, apparently, is boring.

17
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:08,220
 And being bored is unpleasant.

18
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:09,840
 So what is boredom?

19
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:15,040
 Well, contrary to popular belief, it's not when you have absolutely nothing to do.

20
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:19,480
 It's just when none of the options you have available to you appeal to you.

21
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:25,920
 Boredom is characterized by a lack of concentration, restlessness, but also feeling lethargic.

22
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,920
 It's really a state of being underwhelmed.

23
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:32,600
 And there are now more ways than ever to avoid boredom.

24
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:38,400
 With Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, YouTube, not to mention my chronic news habit,

25
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,880
 waiting in line, sitting in a coffee shop, stopped at a traffic light,

26
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:55,473
 many people reach for their phones to stave off boredom And nowhere is sacred Do you ever just let yourself be bored No No I generally don But are we losing anything by avoiding boredom

27
00:01:56,113 --> 00:01:58,053
 Well, scientific research says yes.

28
00:01:58,553 --> 00:02:00,933
 And what we're losing is important.

29
00:02:03,293 --> 00:02:06,113
 When you're bored, your mind wanders.

30
00:02:07,413 --> 00:02:08,813
 That's only natural.

31
00:02:09,953 --> 00:02:14,773
 The state of boredom is one where your attention is not focused on anything in particular.

32
00:02:15,353 --> 00:02:22,313
 Researchers have shown this mind-wandering is useful for creativity.

33
00:02:22,313 --> 00:02:25,533
 They gave study participants a random boring task.

34
00:02:25,533 --> 00:02:27,253
 The most boring one?

35
00:02:27,253 --> 00:02:29,473
 Reading the phone book.

36
00:02:29,473 --> 00:02:32,093
 Then they asked participants to be creative.

37
00:02:32,093 --> 00:02:36,773
 Generate as many ideas as they could for what you could do with a plastic cup.

38
00:02:36,773 --> 00:02:41,653
 Those in the most boring read the phone book condition generated the most creative solutions

39
00:02:41,653 --> 00:02:44,153
 compared to less bored controls.

40
00:02:45,953 --> 00:02:49,953
 A major reason many researchers suspect that we experience boredom

41
00:02:49,953 --> 00:02:53,053
 is because it gives you an indicator of your current state.

42
00:02:53,053 --> 00:02:55,353
 I mean, if you find yourself feeling bored,

43
00:02:55,353 --> 00:02:58,153
 you know something about that situation isn't working for you.

44
00:02:58,153 --> 00:03:00,753
 Let me ask you this, when you're in class and you're a bit bored,

45
00:03:00,753 --> 00:03:02,953
 do you ever just pull out your phone and have a look at stuff?

46
00:03:02,953 --> 00:03:04,153
 Yeah, all the time.

47
00:03:05,653 --> 00:03:10,453
 So the paradox of boredom is that it makes you feel tired, sluggish,

48
00:03:10,453 --> 00:03:12,453
 and just disinterested.

49
00:03:12,453 --> 00:03:15,293
 But it may actually spur you to action.

50
00:03:15,293 --> 00:03:19,633
 It may get you to make changes that would be positive for your life.

51
00:03:19,633 --> 00:03:22,713
 And changes like getting this guy's legs out of my face.

52
00:03:22,713 --> 00:03:23,973
 That would be perfect.

53
00:03:25,793 --> 00:03:27,513
 In the absence of boredom,

54
00:03:27,513 --> 00:03:30,893
 one would remain trapped in unfulfilling situations

55
00:03:30,893 --> 00:03:49,906
 and miss out on many emotionally cognitively and socially rewarding experiences Boredom is both a warning that we not doing what we want to be doing and a push that motivates us to switch goals and projects Studies have also shown that boredom may make you more altruistic Perhaps the acute sense of

56
00:03:49,906 --> 00:03:53,506
 aimlessness you experience when you're bored gets out of control and makes you

57
00:03:53,506 --> 00:03:57,666
 question what you're doing with your life as a whole. But the silver lining is

58
00:03:57,666 --> 00:04:00,986
 that it may trigger you to think about others and what you can do to help them.

59
00:04:00,986 --> 00:04:05,106
 And that provides an immediate and concrete purpose to a life that might

60
00:04:05,106 --> 00:04:07,826
 momentarily feel like it's lacking one.

61
00:04:07,826 --> 00:04:12,226
 You know, studies designed to induce boredom have shown that more bored participants are

62
00:04:12,226 --> 00:04:14,986
 more likely to donate to charity or to give blood.

63
00:04:14,986 --> 00:04:18,046
 Can I ask what led you to donate blood today?

64
00:04:18,046 --> 00:04:23,186
 Um, I had free time on my hands, you know, just waiting until two hours, an hour and

65
00:04:23,186 --> 00:04:24,186
 a half or so.

66
00:04:24,186 --> 00:04:30,706
 So apparently the opportunity to do meaningful, even if unpleasant activities, have more value

67
00:04:30,706 --> 00:04:33,346
 if you're bored than if you're not.

68
00:04:33,346 --> 00:04:39,346
 Similarly, this aimless state seems to cultivate thoughts about what you want to do with your life.

69
00:04:39,346 --> 00:04:44,146
 To think of your life as a story and consider where you want it to go in the future.

70
00:04:44,146 --> 00:04:46,706
 This is called autobiographical planning.

71
00:04:46,706 --> 00:04:50,146
 When given tasks that only use a fraction of mental capacity,

72
00:04:50,146 --> 00:04:54,386
 study participants frequently thought of the future and their plans for it.

73
00:04:54,386 --> 00:04:57,986
 In this way, being bored is essential for goal setting.

74
00:04:57,986 --> 00:05:01,666
 If your brain is always consumed with other stimuli,

75
00:05:01,666 --> 00:05:07,666
 You'll rarely ponder the bigger picture and set long-term goals for yourself and consider how to achieve them.

76
00:05:07,666 --> 00:05:09,666
 Does a phone get rid of your boredom?

77
00:05:11,066 --> 00:05:14,666
 Yeah, actually thinking about it, it does.

78
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:20,666
 So every time you're waiting for something, you have a decision to make, which seems like a tiny one.

79
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:24,666
 Pull out your phone for a few seconds or minutes or just be bored.

80
00:05:24,666 --> 00:05:36,159
 Experience only your thoughts It seems like an insignificant decision And if you don give it much thought the obvious action is to see what new on your app of choice And in making that decision

81
00:05:36,459 --> 00:05:42,759
 you are alleviating a moment of boredom. But you are also likely making yourself less creative,

82
00:05:43,058 --> 00:05:47,538
 less altruistic, less likely to assess your current state, and less likely to set goals

83
00:05:47,538 --> 00:05:53,259
 for your future. In short, you are the real world example of someone shocking themselves

84
00:05:53,259 --> 00:05:55,938
 to avoid the unpleasantness of boredom.

85
00:05:56,599 --> 00:05:59,339
 Except in your case, the pain goes much deeper

86
00:05:59,339 --> 00:06:02,798
 to the very nature of who you are and who you will become.

87
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:06,639
 So think carefully before pressing that button.

88
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:15,998
 So being bored is apparently something our brains need to do.

89
00:06:16,318 --> 00:06:20,479
 Something our brains don't need to do is remember lots of random passwords,

90
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:23,919
 which is why the sponsor of this video is LastPass.

91
00:06:24,318 --> 00:06:28,779
 LastPass is a password manager that offers unlimited password storage,

92
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:33,818
 plus free sync across all your devices and password breach alerts.

93
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:37,919
 That way you never have to remember another password or write it down,

94
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:40,519
 look for one, forget your passwords, reset them.

95
00:06:40,719 --> 00:06:46,938
 All of that hassle is just pushed aside and you can put your passwords on autopilot with LastPass.

96
00:06:46,938 --> 00:06:52,378
 and that way you can free up your valuable brain space for just being bored and thinking about your

97
00:06:52,378 --> 00:06:58,058
 life rather than remembering your passwords. Now LastPass has multi-factor authentication which is

98
00:06:58,058 --> 00:07:02,859
 super important because it keeps your account secure. It also interfaces with Microsoft and

99
00:07:02,859 --> 00:07:07,818
 YubiKeys multi-factor authentication. And one feature I love about LastPass is it allows you

100
00:07:07,818 --> 00:07:13,579
 to share safely and securely your passwords with other people who may need them for certain

101
00:07:13,579 --> 00:07:18,139
 accounts. That's a very handy feature. So if you want to check out LastPass,
