1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,260
 Okay, so imagine two plants claiming unlimited cover.

2
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:09,920
 One says zero waiting period, the other gives you 21 add-ons and unlimited bonus accumulation

3
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:12,860
 and even AI-driven face scans to check your vitals.

4
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:14,660
 Sounds insane, right?

5
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:19,000
 Hello folks, today we're comparing two of the most talked about plants in the Indian

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,640
 health insurance space, Aquaplatinum and Superstar by Star Health.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,120
 And trust me, this one's going to surprise you.

8
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:29,340
 Hi folks, I'm Shashank and you're watching Ditto Insurance and we help you understand

9
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:34,920
 health insurance in a way that no one else does. No spam, no pressure, just pure clarity.

10
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:38,700
 If you want help figuring out which plan actually fits your life, book a free call with our

11
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:43,100
 advisors. The link is in the description. Now, here's what we're going to do in this

12
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:47,780
 video. We'll start with the basic features, what's common in both plans, then we'll move

13
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:52,880
 on to where they start to differ and which plan does what better. After that, we'll look

14
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:58,720
 at some standout features that really matter and then what you're waiting for, premiums.

15
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:02,220
 Because let's be honest, cost is always part of the decision.

16
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:06,260
 And finally, we'll tell you which plan Rito actually recommends and for whom.

17
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:08,100
 So first, the basics.

18
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:09,880
 What do both plans do right?

19
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:13,840
 Both Akko and Star's Superstar plan offer full room rent flexibility.

20
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,360
 That means any room, no caps.

21
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,680
 Which is great.

22
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:23,020
 Both cover your pre and post hospitalization expenses 60-90 days before admission and up

23
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:25,260
 to 180 days after discharge.

24
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:30,420
 They cover daycare procedures, organ donor costs, domiciliary hospitalization, AYUSH,

25
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:31,680
 basically the works.

26
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:37,200
 They also cover consumables like gloves, syringes, PPE kits which are often not covered by other

27
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,300
 plans until you have an add-on.

28
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:44,220
 You also get ambulance charge, unlimited e-consultations and general wellness perks.

29
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:46,560
 So far, it's fairly matched.

30
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,260
 But now, here comes the real game, the pure differences.

31
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:51,540
 Let's start with aquaplatin.

32
00:01:51,540 --> 00:02:04,772
 The most eye feature here is the claim of zero waiting period And yes that sounds incredible on paper But there a catch While ACO doesn impose waiting periods for common things like cataracts or hernia

33
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:07,952
 the same doesn't apply to pre-existing conditions.

34
00:02:08,292 --> 00:02:10,972
 That part is still subject to medical underwriting.

35
00:02:11,112 --> 00:02:14,772
 Which means, if you have a condition like diabetes or thyroid,

36
00:02:14,972 --> 00:02:18,772
 they may still impose a 2-3 year waiting period based on your health profile.

37
00:02:18,772 --> 00:02:22,592
 So it's not truly zero waiting period across the board.

38
00:02:23,092 --> 00:02:24,632
 And that's important to know before you buy.

39
00:02:24,832 --> 00:02:27,052
 Then there's the unlimited sum insured.

40
00:02:27,372 --> 00:02:28,892
 But here's a reality check.

41
00:02:29,092 --> 00:02:31,672
 In India, even the most complex surgeries,

42
00:02:31,972 --> 00:02:34,352
 say liver transplants or high-end cancer care,

43
00:02:34,632 --> 00:02:36,732
 don't usually cross one crore rupees.

44
00:02:36,972 --> 00:02:39,632
 So while unlimited is great for peace of mind,

45
00:02:40,012 --> 00:02:43,092
 it's more psychological than practical for most families.

46
00:02:43,432 --> 00:02:46,652
 Another thing, Ako is a 100% digital platform.

47
00:02:46,652 --> 00:02:51,052
 You buy it online, you raise claims online, you talk to that team directly.

48
00:02:51,612 --> 00:02:53,512
 No agents, no intermediaries.

49
00:02:53,932 --> 00:02:56,812
 This is the reason why their premiums are super low.

50
00:02:57,092 --> 00:02:59,952
 But it also means that if there's a delay or issue with your claim,

51
00:03:00,332 --> 00:03:02,712
 you might be the one chasing them, not an agent.

52
00:03:02,972 --> 00:03:06,932
 So if you're someone who prefers a little hand-holding or offline assistance,

53
00:03:07,132 --> 00:03:08,232
 that could be a deal-breaker.

54
00:03:08,552 --> 00:03:09,872
 Now, let's see the pricing.

55
00:03:10,132 --> 00:03:12,092
 ACCO is quite hard to beat.

56
00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:15,312
 For a 30-year-old in Delhi looking for 1 crore cover,

57
00:03:15,312 --> 00:03:21,912
 the annual premium is around 16,000 rupees. For two 30-year-olds, it's around 20,000 rupees.

58
00:03:22,112 --> 00:03:26,252
 That's easily 25-30% more cheaper than competitive plans.

59
00:03:26,612 --> 00:03:32,592
 Now, let's look at Superstar from Star Health. First, the big picture. Star has been around for

60
00:03:32,592 --> 00:03:39,192
 18 plus years, massive network of 14,000 plus hospitals. They're big on variety. But, and this

61
00:03:39,192 --> 00:03:44,892
 is a big but, their claims helpment ratio is only about 83% based on the last three years. That's

62
00:03:44,892 --> 00:03:47,892
 much much lower than the industry average.

63
00:03:47,892 --> 00:04:02,403
 And their complaint volume is highly concerning which is 46 behind every 10 claims almost 3 times ACCO numbers So yes the plan is strong but as an insurer Star has some red flags There have been reports of hospitals refusing cashless claims

64
00:04:02,843 --> 00:04:05,703
 reviews online are mixed, and if you're considering Star,

65
00:04:05,983 --> 00:04:09,243
 then just know that your claim experience may not always be smooth,

66
00:04:09,323 --> 00:04:11,783
 unless you have a really good advisor who can fight for you.

67
00:04:12,003 --> 00:04:15,763
 That said, Superstar as a product, solid, surprisingly solid.

68
00:04:15,763 --> 00:04:19,563
 It offers multiple sum and short options from 5 lakh rupees to unlimited,

69
00:04:19,823 --> 00:04:23,083
 And you can even buy the policy for up to 5 years in one go.

70
00:04:23,303 --> 00:04:25,223
 So, that way, you beat inflation.

71
00:04:25,543 --> 00:04:30,083
 Now, there is no copay, there is no disease by sublimits, no room rent limits.

72
00:04:30,383 --> 00:04:33,783
 The restoration benefit, you can restore 100% of your sum insured,

73
00:04:34,103 --> 00:04:36,183
 unlimited times, even for the same illness.

74
00:04:36,363 --> 00:04:37,383
 Here is the real kicker.

75
00:04:37,863 --> 00:04:39,443
 They play well on add-ons.

76
00:04:39,443 --> 00:04:42,823
 Now, you get access to 21 optional covers.

77
00:04:43,343 --> 00:04:44,983
 Do you want maternity? It's there.

78
00:04:45,143 --> 00:04:47,943
 Want to cut your PED waiting period from 3 years to 12 months?

79
00:04:48,243 --> 00:04:48,903
 There's an add-on.

80
00:04:48,903 --> 00:04:55,843
 Want diagnostic cover, dental cleaning, second medical opinion or even premium waiver if diagnosed with critical illness?

81
00:04:56,223 --> 00:04:57,863
 All possible with add-ons.

82
00:04:58,303 --> 00:05:00,623
 There's even a cool feature called freeze your age.

83
00:05:01,003 --> 00:05:04,703
 As long as you don't make a claim, your premiums won't increase with age.

84
00:05:05,123 --> 00:05:07,743
 So, you can literally freeze your pricing.

85
00:05:08,083 --> 00:05:11,423
 So, why isn't everyone buying Superstar, you ask?

86
00:05:11,883 --> 00:05:14,703
 Well, again, the problem isn't the product.

87
00:05:14,883 --> 00:05:15,923
 The product is solid.

88
00:05:15,923 --> 00:05:21,783
 it's the brand. Low claim settlement, high complaint volume, patchy servicing. So if you're

89
00:05:21,783 --> 00:05:26,263
 going to buy Star anyways, you need someone who knows how to navigate their system. Ideally,

90
00:05:26,383 --> 00:05:31,283
 an agent or advisor with experience in handling their post-sales process. By the way, if you want

91
00:05:31,283 --> 00:05:36,183
 help evaluating whether Superstar is right for you or if any other plan is the best choice for you

92
00:05:36,183 --> 00:05:41,523
 or want to know which add-ons are worth paying for and which are just fluff, this book of recall

93
00:05:41,523 --> 00:05:45,963
 with ditto. We'll break it down all for you. The link's in the description. Now, let's

94
00:05:45,963 --> 00:05:58,235
 compare premiums For a 30 year old in a metro city looking at 1 crore coverage Akko comes in at 16 rupees Superstar that also comes in around 16 rupees but without any add

95
00:05:58,235 --> 00:05:59,835
 If you choose add-ons like consumables,

96
00:05:59,835 --> 00:06:01,835
 waiting period reduction and diagnostics,

97
00:06:01,835 --> 00:06:05,035
 you'll probably end up paying close to 17 to 18,000 rupees,

98
00:06:05,035 --> 00:06:07,835
 putting it in the same ballpark as Akko.

99
00:06:07,835 --> 00:06:09,635
 So, for two 30 year olds,

100
00:06:09,635 --> 00:06:13,035
 Akko will charge around 21,000 for a 1 crore cover.

101
00:06:13,035 --> 00:06:15,835
 And Superstar starts at 13,978,

102
00:06:15,835 --> 00:06:17,215
 but this again is the base cover.

103
00:06:17,455 --> 00:06:19,735
 So, pricing isn't the big differentiator.

104
00:06:20,155 --> 00:06:21,915
 The real difference isn't philosophy.

105
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:24,695
 ACO is built for the do-it-yourself customer.

106
00:06:25,215 --> 00:06:28,915
 If you're healthy, under 35, don't have any PEDs,

107
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:30,795
 and don't mind managing things online,

108
00:06:31,355 --> 00:06:33,195
 ACO offers unbeatable value.

109
00:06:33,435 --> 00:06:35,355
 Superstar is more like a buffet plan.

110
00:06:35,355 --> 00:06:39,435
 You start with a solid base and add the features that you want.

111
00:06:39,675 --> 00:06:42,495
 It's perfect for people who have specific medical need

112
00:06:42,495 --> 00:06:48,255
 or someone who might want high-end customization, maternity or critical illness support.

113
00:06:48,615 --> 00:06:54,075
 But the catch is, only buy it if you're confident you'll get proper help during claims.

114
00:06:54,595 --> 00:06:56,715
 Because that's where Star can stumble.

115
00:06:57,055 --> 00:06:58,815
 So what does Ditto recommend?

116
00:06:59,335 --> 00:07:05,655
 If you're young, digital savvy and want clean, low-cost, no-nonsense protection, go with Aquaplatin.

117
00:07:05,655 --> 00:07:11,415
 If you're older or someone with specific medical needs and want a plan you can tweak and control

118
00:07:11,415 --> 00:07:13,815
 and you're okay with occasional claim friction,

119
00:07:14,115 --> 00:07:15,755
 superstar could be a good fit.

120
00:07:16,015 --> 00:07:17,195
 But in both cases,

121
00:07:17,475 --> 00:07:19,435
 the right advice can make all the difference.

122
00:07:19,595 --> 00:07:20,755
 So if you're unsure

123
00:07:20,755 --> 00:07:23,655
 or just want someone to sanity check your current policy,

124
00:07:24,075 --> 00:07:24,995

 no charges,

 So folks, I will see you in the next one.

134
00:07:36,695 --> 00:07:37,355
 And remember,

135
00:07:37,535 --> 00:07:38,875
 buying health insurance is easy,

136
00:07:39,015 --> 00:07:39,975
 but buying the right one,

137
00:07:40,335 --> 00:07:41,355
 that's where it gets tricky.

138
00:07:41,415 --> 00:07:43,175
 Let's make sure that you get it right.

139
00:07:43,175 --> 00:07:44,255
 I'll see you in the next one.

140
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:45,815
 Until then, happy insurance hunting.
