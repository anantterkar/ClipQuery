[0.00 - 4.26]  Okay, so imagine two plants claiming unlimited cover.
[4.46 - 9.92]  One says zero waiting period, the other gives you 21 add-ons and unlimited bonus accumulation
[9.92 - 12.86]  and even AI-driven face scans to check your vitals.
[13.12 - 14.66]  Sounds insane, right?
[15.18 - 19.00]  Hello folks, today we're comparing two of the most talked about plants in the Indian
[19.00 - 22.64]  health insurance space, Aquaplatinum and Superstar by Star Health.
[23.00 - 25.12]  And trust me, this one's going to surprise you.
[25.24 - 29.34]  Hi folks, I'm Shashank and you're watching Ditto Insurance and we help you understand
[29.34 - 34.92]  health insurance in a way that no one else does. No spam, no pressure, just pure clarity.
[34.92 - 38.70]  If you want help figuring out which plan actually fits your life, book a free call with our
[38.70 - 43.10]  advisors. The link is in the description. Now, here's what we're going to do in this
[43.10 - 47.78]  video. We'll start with the basic features, what's common in both plans, then we'll move
[47.78 - 52.88]  on to where they start to differ and which plan does what better. After that, we'll look
[52.88 - 58.72]  at some standout features that really matter and then what you're waiting for, premiums.
[58.72 - 62.22]  Because let's be honest, cost is always part of the decision.
[62.22 - 66.26]  And finally, we'll tell you which plan Rito actually recommends and for whom.
[66.26 - 68.10]  So first, the basics.
[68.10 - 69.88]  What do both plans do right?
[69.88 - 73.84]  Both Akko and Star's Superstar plan offer full room rent flexibility.
[73.84 - 76.36]  That means any room, no caps.
[76.36 - 77.68]  Which is great.
[77.68 - 83.02]  Both cover your pre and post hospitalization expenses 60-90 days before admission and up
[83.02 - 85.26]  to 180 days after discharge.
[85.26 - 90.42]  They cover daycare procedures, organ donor costs, domiciliary hospitalization, AYUSH,
[90.42 - 91.68]  basically the works.
[91.68 - 97.20]  They also cover consumables like gloves, syringes, PPE kits which are often not covered by other
[97.20 - 99.30]  plans until you have an add-on.
[99.30 - 104.22]  You also get ambulance charge, unlimited e-consultations and general wellness perks.
[104.22 - 106.56]  So far, it's fairly matched.
[106.56 - 110.26]  But now, here comes the real game, the pure differences.
[110.26 - 111.54]  Let's start with aquaplatin.
[111.54 - 124.77]  The most eye feature here is the claim of zero waiting period And yes that sounds incredible on paper But there a catch While ACO doesn impose waiting periods for common things like cataracts or hernia
[125.29 - 127.95]  the same doesn't apply to pre-existing conditions.
[128.29 - 130.97]  That part is still subject to medical underwriting.
[131.11 - 134.77]  Which means, if you have a condition like diabetes or thyroid,
[134.97 - 138.77]  they may still impose a 2-3 year waiting period based on your health profile.
[138.77 - 142.59]  So it's not truly zero waiting period across the board.
[143.09 - 144.63]  And that's important to know before you buy.
[144.83 - 147.05]  Then there's the unlimited sum insured.
[147.37 - 148.89]  But here's a reality check.
[149.09 - 151.67]  In India, even the most complex surgeries,
[151.97 - 154.35]  say liver transplants or high-end cancer care,
[154.63 - 156.73]  don't usually cross one crore rupees.
[156.97 - 159.63]  So while unlimited is great for peace of mind,
[160.01 - 163.09]  it's more psychological than practical for most families.
[163.43 - 166.65]  Another thing, Ako is a 100% digital platform.
[166.65 - 171.05]  You buy it online, you raise claims online, you talk to that team directly.
[171.61 - 173.51]  No agents, no intermediaries.
[173.93 - 176.81]  This is the reason why their premiums are super low.
[177.09 - 179.95]  But it also means that if there's a delay or issue with your claim,
[180.33 - 182.71]  you might be the one chasing them, not an agent.
[182.97 - 186.93]  So if you're someone who prefers a little hand-holding or offline assistance,
[187.13 - 188.23]  that could be a deal-breaker.
[188.55 - 189.87]  Now, let's see the pricing.
[190.13 - 192.09]  ACCO is quite hard to beat.
[192.29 - 195.31]  For a 30-year-old in Delhi looking for 1 crore cover,
[195.31 - 201.91]  the annual premium is around 16,000 rupees. For two 30-year-olds, it's around 20,000 rupees.
[202.11 - 206.25]  That's easily 25-30% more cheaper than competitive plans.
[206.61 - 212.59]  Now, let's look at Superstar from Star Health. First, the big picture. Star has been around for
[212.59 - 219.19]  18 plus years, massive network of 14,000 plus hospitals. They're big on variety. But, and this
[219.19 - 224.89]  is a big but, their claims helpment ratio is only about 83% based on the last three years. That's
[224.89 - 227.89]  much much lower than the industry average.
[227.89 - 242.40]  And their complaint volume is highly concerning which is 46 behind every 10 claims almost 3 times ACCO numbers So yes the plan is strong but as an insurer Star has some red flags There have been reports of hospitals refusing cashless claims
[242.84 - 245.70]  reviews online are mixed, and if you're considering Star,
[245.98 - 249.24]  then just know that your claim experience may not always be smooth,
[249.32 - 251.78]  unless you have a really good advisor who can fight for you.
[252.00 - 255.76]  That said, Superstar as a product, solid, surprisingly solid.
[255.76 - 259.56]  It offers multiple sum and short options from 5 lakh rupees to unlimited,
[259.82 - 263.08]  And you can even buy the policy for up to 5 years in one go.
[263.30 - 265.22]  So, that way, you beat inflation.
[265.54 - 270.08]  Now, there is no copay, there is no disease by sublimits, no room rent limits.
[270.38 - 273.78]  The restoration benefit, you can restore 100% of your sum insured,
[274.10 - 276.18]  unlimited times, even for the same illness.
[276.36 - 277.38]  Here is the real kicker.
[277.86 - 279.44]  They play well on add-ons.
[279.44 - 282.82]  Now, you get access to 21 optional covers.
[283.34 - 284.98]  Do you want maternity? It's there.
[285.14 - 287.94]  Want to cut your PED waiting period from 3 years to 12 months?
[288.24 - 288.90]  There's an add-on.
[288.90 - 295.84]  Want diagnostic cover, dental cleaning, second medical opinion or even premium waiver if diagnosed with critical illness?
[296.22 - 297.86]  All possible with add-ons.
[298.30 - 300.62]  There's even a cool feature called freeze your age.
[301.00 - 304.70]  As long as you don't make a claim, your premiums won't increase with age.
[305.12 - 307.74]  So, you can literally freeze your pricing.
[308.08 - 311.42]  So, why isn't everyone buying Superstar, you ask?
[311.88 - 314.70]  Well, again, the problem isn't the product.
[314.88 - 315.92]  The product is solid.
[315.92 - 321.78]  it's the brand. Low claim settlement, high complaint volume, patchy servicing. So if you're
[321.78 - 326.26]  going to buy Star anyways, you need someone who knows how to navigate their system. Ideally,
[326.38 - 331.28]  an agent or advisor with experience in handling their post-sales process. By the way, if you want
[331.28 - 336.18]  help evaluating whether Superstar is right for you or if any other plan is the best choice for you
[336.18 - 341.52]  or want to know which add-ons are worth paying for and which are just fluff, this book of recall
[341.52 - 345.96]  with ditto. We'll break it down all for you. The link's in the description. Now, let's
[345.96 - 358.24]  compare premiums For a 30 year old in a metro city looking at 1 crore coverage Akko comes in at 16 rupees Superstar that also comes in around 16 rupees but without any add
[358.24 - 359.84]  If you choose add-ons like consumables,
[359.84 - 361.84]  waiting period reduction and diagnostics,
[361.84 - 365.04]  you'll probably end up paying close to 17 to 18,000 rupees,
[365.04 - 367.84]  putting it in the same ballpark as Akko.
[367.84 - 369.64]  So, for two 30 year olds,
[369.64 - 373.04]  Akko will charge around 21,000 for a 1 crore cover.
[373.04 - 375.84]  And Superstar starts at 13,978,
[375.84 - 377.22]  but this again is the base cover.
[377.46 - 379.74]  So, pricing isn't the big differentiator.
[380.16 - 381.92]  The real difference isn't philosophy.
[382.22 - 384.70]  ACO is built for the do-it-yourself customer.
[385.22 - 388.92]  If you're healthy, under 35, don't have any PEDs,
[389.06 - 390.80]  and don't mind managing things online,
[391.36 - 393.20]  ACO offers unbeatable value.
[393.44 - 395.36]  Superstar is more like a buffet plan.
[395.36 - 399.44]  You start with a solid base and add the features that you want.
[399.68 - 402.50]  It's perfect for people who have specific medical need
[402.50 - 408.26]  or someone who might want high-end customization, maternity or critical illness support.
[408.62 - 414.08]  But the catch is, only buy it if you're confident you'll get proper help during claims.
[414.60 - 416.72]  Because that's where Star can stumble.
[417.06 - 418.82]  So what does Ditto recommend?
[419.34 - 425.66]  If you're young, digital savvy and want clean, low-cost, no-nonsense protection, go with Aquaplatin.
[425.66 - 431.42]  If you're older or someone with specific medical needs and want a plan you can tweak and control
[431.42 - 433.82]  and you're okay with occasional claim friction,
[434.12 - 435.76]  superstar could be a good fit.
[436.02 - 437.20]  But in both cases,
[437.48 - 439.44]  the right advice can make all the difference.
[439.60 - 440.76]  So if you're unsure
[440.76 - 443.66]  or just want someone to sanity check your current policy,

[457.54 - 458.88]  buying health insurance is easy,
[459.02 - 459.98]  but buying the right one,
[460.34 - 461.36]  that's where it gets tricky.
[461.42 - 463.18]  Let's make sure that you get it right.
[463.18 - 464.26]  I'll see you in the next one.
