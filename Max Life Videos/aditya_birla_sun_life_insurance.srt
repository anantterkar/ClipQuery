00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,640
 Hi folks, I'm Shashank. I work with Ditto Insurance. We are an insurance advisory platform

 where we deal with health and term insurance plans. Now, if you are out here looking for

3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:18,960
 quality advice, then we recommend you to book a free of course consultation with our advisors

4
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,080
 with the link in the description. With the introduction out of the way, folks, let me

5
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:29,520
 now introduce our guest today, Sushant. He is the Senior Program Manager here at Ditto.

6
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:34,840
 And today we are going to talk about Aditya Birla's Sun Life Insurance. Sushant, welcome

7
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:39,720
 to the podcast. Thanks for having me. So Sushant, let's start with the introduction and the

8
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:44,600
 basic metrics, how they're operating. So take us through the details. So they actually do

9
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:51,600
 have quite an interesting story. Aditya Birla Sun Life was established in the year 2000.

10
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,280
 And it's actually a joint venture between Aditya Birla Capital and Sun Life Insurance

11
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:01,240
 Inc. from Canada. So yeah, and I think over the last 20-25 years, they've really established

12
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:07,080
 themselves by offering a very diversified portfolio of plans, ranging from term insurance

13
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:12,440
 to ULIPs to endowments, even child plans and retirement plans as well. So I think they've

14
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:16,280
 really tried to cater to pretty much all the sort of sectors of the audience.

15
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:21,640
 Alright, alright. And how are they operationally? I think if I were to talk about their metrics,

16
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:25,880
 first if we look at claim settlement ratio, for example, quite good. In the recent years,

17
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:30,760
 their average has been just over 98%, which is well above the industry average and a really

18
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:35,120
 good number. If I were to talk about amount settlement ratio, pretty solid in that front

19
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:41,960
 too, about 94% change, which is pretty good. Coming to the complaints volume, very reasonable.

20
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:46,200
 For every 10,000 claims, they've had just five complaints. Once again, that's well below

21
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:50,120
 the industry average. And in terms of annual business, they've been growing steadily year

22
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:54,760
 on year. So we're looking at about 6,500 crores of annual business per year.

23
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:59,880
 Okay, pretty solid metrics over there. Now let's talk about their offerings in terms of term plans.

24
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:05,160
 So they have about three term plans. If I were to pick their flagship one, which is called DigiShield.

25
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:10,280
 Under that is about 10 variants or options that you can play around with. So one would be a return

26
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:14,840
 of premium variant, where you get your money back at the end of the plan. One would be a whole life

27
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:20,440
 cover, where you're allowed to be insured for the entirety of your life, meaning until 99 or 100

28
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:25,320
 years of age. If I were to talk about the age of entry for this plan, it's about 18 to 65.

29
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:30,040
 For some insured, you're allowed to buy a minimum of 30 lakhs and there's no upper limit,

30
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:34,920
 which is quite interesting. Most companies set a cap that you can't buy more than 10, 20, 30 crores.

31
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:38,840
 Here there is no cap, of course, subject to your eligibility and underwriting.

32
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:43,080
 In terms of riders and optional benefits that they offer, there are some interesting features

33
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:47,560
 there too. They have an accidental death and disability benefit, wherein for an accidental

34
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:52,200
 death you're paid a higher sum in short. For an accident disability, you're paid a percentage of

35
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:56,760
 the rider based on the disability that happens and this is all clearly listed out. They have a

36
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:00,760
 critical illness variant, even though they have two options. So one is a critical illness accelerated

37
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:05,960
 variant covering about 42 illnesses and then there's a normal critical illness variant covering just

38
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:10,280
 four critical illnesses. So I feel there maybe they probably are lacking a little bit, whereas

39
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:15,800
 other brands offer the 20, 30, 40 illnesses. So that's probably one place where I would say

40
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:20,200
 they're slightly lacking. They also offer another free benefit called the life stage benefit,

41
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:24,280
 where you're allowed to increase your sum insured up to 100% in the future based on certain life

42
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:29,800
 stages like marriage and having kids. This plan also comes with an inbuilt terminal illness benefit.

43
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:34,280
 In case someone's terminally ill, they can claim an accelerated amount of their term insurance.

44
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:39,960
 Lastly, they have some unique features such as a surgical care rider, meaning in case you require

45
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:44,520
 a surgery of some sorts, diagnosed and approved by a medical professional, they will pay up a

46
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:48,440
 certain amount to financially support you. And they also have a hospice care benefit,

47
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:53,400
 which very few insurance companies offer, which is more of a health insurance benefit if you ask me.

48
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:57,880
 But how this feature works is once you're admitted to the hospital, if you're there for more than two

49
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:02,600
 or three days, they give you a certain daily cash allowance. Daily cash is what we call it in health

50
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:07,320
 insurance terms, but in term insurance they call it the hospice care benefit. So you're given a daily

51
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:12,280
 allowance every day to kind of help you with miscellaneous expenses. But yeah, I think that

52
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:17,000
 more or less summarizes the DigiShield plan. DigiShield is a really, really comprehensive

53
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,520
 plan. Now, I've also gone through the brochure and they also have something called as an income

54
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:27,560
 suraccia plan. Some more details on that? This actually is a very interesting take on term

55
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:31,720
 insurance. They've really approached it from a different angle altogether. So even under this,

56
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:38,120
 there are two variants. One is called the fixed income plan, wherein they focus on giving your

57
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:42,920
 nominees the death benefit in the form of monthly income. So how they've done it is that you get to

58
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:46,440
 choose what amount you want your nominees to receive. For example, you say that I want them

59
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:50,920
 to receive one lakh rupees per month in case something were to happen to me. They offer this

60
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:56,760
 for a fixed tenure of 10 years or the remaining of the policy tenure, whichever is higher.

61
00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:01,560
 So if I were to give you an example, let's say I buy a term insurance for 30 years and the person

62
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:06,360
 or the insured member passes away in the 15th year. Now his family will receive one lakh per month for

63
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:11,240
 the next 15 years because that was the remaining of the policy tenure. This is one example. So the

64
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:15,720
 other one is the increasing income protection variant that they have. Here how it works is

65
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:20,440
 whatever income you've decided that your family should receive, that amount will keep increasing

66
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:25,400
 by 5% year on year from the date you've bought the plan. The tenure here remains the same. The

67
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:31,000
 payout tenure is 120 months or 10 years basically. So meaning if someone has bought a plan and five

68
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,560
 years later he were to pass away. Now initially when he bought the plan, he opted for one lakh

69
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:40,600
 rupees as monthly income. But in those five years this has been compounding. So now five years later

70
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:46,600
 when something happens, his family is eligible to receive 1.21 lakhs or so approximately per month.

71
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:51,480
 And this will still keep increasing as it's paid out until it reaches an upper cap of about 1.5

72
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:56,920
 lakh rupees. So basically 1.5 times of the income you asked for. Should you have asked for 2 lakhs,

73
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:02,120
 it will grow until it reaches 3 lakhs. 1.5x essentially. Understood. Quite interesting

74
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:07,320
 variance. I think something unheard of altogether in term insurance. True. But if you were to ask me

75
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:13,000
 and we even consulted with a few financial experts, they're also of the opinion that look maybe this

76
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,040
 variant isn't the most helpful or beneficial. And like I said I'm of the same opinion as well.

77
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:22,200
 I believe with term insurance or life insurance should have a lump sum payout to the nominees or

78
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:26,680
 family members. Exactly. Reason being this gives them the flexibility to do what they want with the

79
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:30,920
 money. You're not leaving it with someone and saying that look I'm happy with the lack of month.

80
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:35,480
 I'd rather the family gets the one or two crores and one if they have any major debts they can

81
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:40,200
 clear them off. They have some big expenses coming up it might support them. Or two at least they can

82
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:44,680
 open something as simple as an FD and kind of generate six seven percent interest every year.

83
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:49,000
 Right. So you have a steady flow of income while you also have that corpus line as a security in

84
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,960
 the bank. Makes sense. So from a financial standpoint I would still always go for a lump sum option.

85
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:58,440
 But I think just how interesting and unique these were I think definitely worth discussing.

86
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:04,760
 Definitely definitely worth mentioning. Now we've covered both these plans. Let's quickly

87
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:10,040
 go into the third plan. So the last variant is called the salaried term plan. As the name suggests

88
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:14,600
 is something that's specifically for salaried individuals only. It comes with some unique

89
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:19,240
 benefits but in a way it's also similar to their DG Shield plan. Okay. Let's say in terms of the

90
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:24,360
 age of entry firstly right 18 to 65 is the maximum age of entry. The duration they were allowed a

91
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:30,520
 maximum tenure of up to 70 years. That's the capping they've set. In terms of the cover amount

92
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:35,560
 25 lakhs is the bare minimum you can choose. And there's no upper limit of course subject to

93
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:39,640
 underwriting and your financial eligibility. It comes with the free rider of terminalist benefits

94
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:43,240
 so that's an added advantage as well. Pricing I think is where they really stand out right.

95
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:47,400
 They've they've really designed this in such a way that they offer some additional discounts

96
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:52,520
 for salaried individuals and also on the basis of gender. Okay. Like we've seen before in term

97
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:57,720
 insurance for females the prices can be lower right considering a higher mortality rate and

98
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:02,200
 longer life expectancy. So these are some of the broad sort of overview if I had to cover them.

99
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:07,160
 In terms of specific pricing though if I had to talk about some numbers for a 25 year old male

100
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:13,720
 buying a one crore term plan the salaried term plan would cost about 9500 or so per year.

101
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:19,880
 Their DG Shield plan would cost about 11000 change and the income plan that we spoke about

102
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:26,200
 that would be somewhere around 25-26000 per year for an income of about 50 000 rupees per month

103
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:31,800
 should something happen. So this is what you can see from the pricing that yes this one is priced

104
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:36,280
 quite competitively right even compared to the DG Shield plan. Correct. And in case if I were

105
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:42,840
 to increase the age of the individual to 35 from 25 what was 9000 change would now become 14000.

106
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:49,800
 The DG Shield which used to be 11 would be about 15-16 and the income plan which is about 25 000

107
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:55,880
 earlier is now looking at about 28-29 000. So more or less a proportion increase nothing significant

108
00:08:55,880 --> 00:09:02,200
 sort of stands out here. Alright so now in terms of the recommendations that we have at the you

109
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:08,920
 know max life HDFC life so how are the premiums priced based on that. So once again let me give

110
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:15,720
 it you with an example of the same profile a 25 year old one crore plan till 65. The DG Shield

111
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:23,240
 plan was about 11500-1600. The salary term plan was about 9500 or so. This is the benchmark we've

112
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:28,040
 set for Atia Birla. Coming to max life they're reasonably priced quite close somewhere about

113
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:36,200
 10100 a year. ICIC is a bit higher at about 10900 and HDFC is even more expensive than the DG Shield

114
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:41,480
 plan they're about 11900. So I think yeah this is what it would compare like you can see they're

115
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:46,680
 quite competitive nothing really stands out or no added advantage either. So they're offering

116
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:51,080
 similar prices but they're also you know competing with some of the largest players out there in the

117
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:58,600
 industry. Alright so finally what's the final word on Atia Birla's and life insurance. So I

118
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:03,160
 think based on our analysis they really do stand out as a solid player right like we just looked

119
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:06,600
 at in terms of pricing as well they're able to compete with some of the large players out there.

120
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:11,560
 In terms of features they're quite comprehensive they offer the accident plans, their waiver of

121
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:16,520
 premium coverage, critical illness all the benefits right that are generally available out there.

122
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:21,400
 Coming to the operational metrics like we saw complaint volume as well was quite low in fact

123
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:26,360
 lower than even some of these brands at about five complaints every 10 000. So honestly from

124
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:30,920
 that front no complaints or no issues as such. The only thing I would say is that yes there is

125
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:35,880
 smaller player when compared to the top three or top five out there. So that's something that's

126
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:39,960
 up to user right whether he wishes to take that risk or would he want more peace of mind going

127
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:44,040
 with one of the larger established players out there. Understood. But other than that nothing

128
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:48,280
 against them they really are a good option available. That's great that's a that's a good

129
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:54,920
 insight Sushant and thank you so much for going into detail of Atia Birla's and life insurance.
