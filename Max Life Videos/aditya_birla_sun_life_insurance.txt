[0.00 - 8.64]  Hi folks, I'm Shashank. I work with Ditto Insurance. We are an insurance advisory platform
[8.64 - 12.96]  where we deal with health and term insurance plans. Now, if you are out here looking for
[12.96 - 18.96]  quality advice, then we recommend you to book a free of course consultation with our advisors
[18.96 - 23.08]  with the link in the description. With the introduction out of the way, folks, let me
[23.08 - 29.52]  now introduce our guest today, Sushant. He is the Senior Program Manager here at Ditto.
[29.52 - 34.84]  And today we are going to talk about Aditya Birla's Sun Life Insurance. Sushant, welcome
[34.84 - 39.72]  to the podcast. Thanks for having me. So Sushant, let's start with the introduction and the
[39.72 - 44.60]  basic metrics, how they're operating. So take us through the details. So they actually do
[44.60 - 51.60]  have quite an interesting story. Aditya Birla Sun Life was established in the year 2000.
[51.60 - 56.28]  And it's actually a joint venture between Aditya Birla Capital and Sun Life Insurance
[56.28 - 61.24]  Inc. from Canada. So yeah, and I think over the last 20-25 years, they've really established
[61.24 - 67.08]  themselves by offering a very diversified portfolio of plans, ranging from term insurance
[67.08 - 72.44]  to ULIPs to endowments, even child plans and retirement plans as well. So I think they've
[72.44 - 76.28]  really tried to cater to pretty much all the sort of sectors of the audience.
[76.28 - 81.64]  Alright, alright. And how are they operationally? I think if I were to talk about their metrics,
[81.64 - 85.88]  first if we look at claim settlement ratio, for example, quite good. In the recent years,
[85.88 - 90.76]  their average has been just over 98%, which is well above the industry average and a really
[90.76 - 95.12]  good number. If I were to talk about amount settlement ratio, pretty solid in that front
[95.12 - 101.96]  too, about 94% change, which is pretty good. Coming to the complaints volume, very reasonable.
[101.96 - 106.20]  For every 10,000 claims, they've had just five complaints. Once again, that's well below
[106.20 - 110.12]  the industry average. And in terms of annual business, they've been growing steadily year
[110.12 - 114.76]  on year. So we're looking at about 6,500 crores of annual business per year.
[114.76 - 119.88]  Okay, pretty solid metrics over there. Now let's talk about their offerings in terms of term plans.
[120.44 - 125.16]  So they have about three term plans. If I were to pick their flagship one, which is called DigiShield.
[125.96 - 130.28]  Under that is about 10 variants or options that you can play around with. So one would be a return
[130.28 - 134.84]  of premium variant, where you get your money back at the end of the plan. One would be a whole life
[134.84 - 140.44]  cover, where you're allowed to be insured for the entirety of your life, meaning until 99 or 100
[140.44 - 145.32]  years of age. If I were to talk about the age of entry for this plan, it's about 18 to 65.
[146.28 - 150.04]  For some insured, you're allowed to buy a minimum of 30 lakhs and there's no upper limit,
[150.04 - 154.92]  which is quite interesting. Most companies set a cap that you can't buy more than 10, 20, 30 crores.
[155.48 - 158.84]  Here there is no cap, of course, subject to your eligibility and underwriting.
[158.84 - 163.08]  In terms of riders and optional benefits that they offer, there are some interesting features
[163.08 - 167.56]  there too. They have an accidental death and disability benefit, wherein for an accidental
[167.56 - 172.20]  death you're paid a higher sum in short. For an accident disability, you're paid a percentage of
[172.20 - 176.76]  the rider based on the disability that happens and this is all clearly listed out. They have a
[176.76 - 180.76]  critical illness variant, even though they have two options. So one is a critical illness accelerated
[180.76 - 185.96]  variant covering about 42 illnesses and then there's a normal critical illness variant covering just
[185.96 - 190.28]  four critical illnesses. So I feel there maybe they probably are lacking a little bit, whereas
[190.28 - 195.80]  other brands offer the 20, 30, 40 illnesses. So that's probably one place where I would say
[195.80 - 200.20]  they're slightly lacking. They also offer another free benefit called the life stage benefit,
[200.20 - 204.28]  where you're allowed to increase your sum insured up to 100% in the future based on certain life
[204.28 - 209.80]  stages like marriage and having kids. This plan also comes with an inbuilt terminal illness benefit.
[209.80 - 214.28]  In case someone's terminally ill, they can claim an accelerated amount of their term insurance.
[215.40 - 219.96]  Lastly, they have some unique features such as a surgical care rider, meaning in case you require
[219.96 - 224.52]  a surgery of some sorts, diagnosed and approved by a medical professional, they will pay up a
[224.52 - 228.44]  certain amount to financially support you. And they also have a hospice care benefit,
[228.44 - 233.40]  which very few insurance companies offer, which is more of a health insurance benefit if you ask me.
[233.40 - 237.88]  But how this feature works is once you're admitted to the hospital, if you're there for more than two
[237.88 - 242.60]  or three days, they give you a certain daily cash allowance. Daily cash is what we call it in health
[242.60 - 247.32]  insurance terms, but in term insurance they call it the hospice care benefit. So you're given a daily
[247.32 - 252.28]  allowance every day to kind of help you with miscellaneous expenses. But yeah, I think that
[252.28 - 257.00]  more or less summarizes the DigiShield plan. DigiShield is a really, really comprehensive
[257.00 - 262.52]  plan. Now, I've also gone through the brochure and they also have something called as an income
[262.52 - 267.56]  suraccia plan. Some more details on that? This actually is a very interesting take on term
[267.56 - 271.72]  insurance. They've really approached it from a different angle altogether. So even under this,
[271.72 - 278.12]  there are two variants. One is called the fixed income plan, wherein they focus on giving your
[278.20 - 282.92]  nominees the death benefit in the form of monthly income. So how they've done it is that you get to
[282.92 - 286.44]  choose what amount you want your nominees to receive. For example, you say that I want them
[286.44 - 290.92]  to receive one lakh rupees per month in case something were to happen to me. They offer this
[290.92 - 296.76]  for a fixed tenure of 10 years or the remaining of the policy tenure, whichever is higher.
[296.76 - 301.56]  So if I were to give you an example, let's say I buy a term insurance for 30 years and the person
[301.56 - 306.36]  or the insured member passes away in the 15th year. Now his family will receive one lakh per month for
[306.36 - 311.24]  the next 15 years because that was the remaining of the policy tenure. This is one example. So the
[311.24 - 315.72]  other one is the increasing income protection variant that they have. Here how it works is
[315.72 - 320.44]  whatever income you've decided that your family should receive, that amount will keep increasing
[320.44 - 325.40]  by 5% year on year from the date you've bought the plan. The tenure here remains the same. The
[325.40 - 331.00]  payout tenure is 120 months or 10 years basically. So meaning if someone has bought a plan and five
[331.00 - 335.56]  years later he were to pass away. Now initially when he bought the plan, he opted for one lakh
[335.56 - 340.60]  rupees as monthly income. But in those five years this has been compounding. So now five years later
[340.60 - 346.60]  when something happens, his family is eligible to receive 1.21 lakhs or so approximately per month.
[346.60 - 351.48]  And this will still keep increasing as it's paid out until it reaches an upper cap of about 1.5
[351.48 - 356.92]  lakh rupees. So basically 1.5 times of the income you asked for. Should you have asked for 2 lakhs,
[356.92 - 362.12]  it will grow until it reaches 3 lakhs. 1.5x essentially. Understood. Quite interesting
[362.12 - 367.32]  variance. I think something unheard of altogether in term insurance. True. But if you were to ask me
[367.32 - 373.00]  and we even consulted with a few financial experts, they're also of the opinion that look maybe this
[373.00 - 378.04]  variant isn't the most helpful or beneficial. And like I said I'm of the same opinion as well.
[378.04 - 382.20]  I believe with term insurance or life insurance should have a lump sum payout to the nominees or
[382.20 - 386.68]  family members. Exactly. Reason being this gives them the flexibility to do what they want with the
[386.68 - 390.92]  money. You're not leaving it with someone and saying that look I'm happy with the lack of month.
[390.92 - 395.48]  I'd rather the family gets the one or two crores and one if they have any major debts they can
[395.48 - 400.20]  clear them off. They have some big expenses coming up it might support them. Or two at least they can
[400.20 - 404.68]  open something as simple as an FD and kind of generate six seven percent interest every year.
[404.68 - 409.00]  Right. So you have a steady flow of income while you also have that corpus line as a security in
[409.00 - 413.96]  the bank. Makes sense. So from a financial standpoint I would still always go for a lump sum option.
[414.68 - 418.44]  But I think just how interesting and unique these were I think definitely worth discussing.
[418.44 - 424.76]  Definitely definitely worth mentioning. Now we've covered both these plans. Let's quickly
[424.76 - 430.04]  go into the third plan. So the last variant is called the salaried term plan. As the name suggests
[430.04 - 434.60]  is something that's specifically for salaried individuals only. It comes with some unique
[434.60 - 439.24]  benefits but in a way it's also similar to their DG Shield plan. Okay. Let's say in terms of the
[439.24 - 444.36]  age of entry firstly right 18 to 65 is the maximum age of entry. The duration they were allowed a
[444.36 - 450.52]  maximum tenure of up to 70 years. That's the capping they've set. In terms of the cover amount
[450.52 - 455.56]  25 lakhs is the bare minimum you can choose. And there's no upper limit of course subject to
[455.56 - 459.64]  underwriting and your financial eligibility. It comes with the free rider of terminalist benefits
[459.64 - 463.24]  so that's an added advantage as well. Pricing I think is where they really stand out right.
[463.24 - 467.40]  They've they've really designed this in such a way that they offer some additional discounts
[467.40 - 472.52]  for salaried individuals and also on the basis of gender. Okay. Like we've seen before in term
[472.52 - 477.72]  insurance for females the prices can be lower right considering a higher mortality rate and
[477.72 - 482.20]  longer life expectancy. So these are some of the broad sort of overview if I had to cover them.
[482.20 - 487.16]  In terms of specific pricing though if I had to talk about some numbers for a 25 year old male
[487.16 - 493.72]  buying a one crore term plan the salaried term plan would cost about 9500 or so per year.
[494.28 - 499.88]  Their DG Shield plan would cost about 11000 change and the income plan that we spoke about
[499.88 - 506.20]  that would be somewhere around 25-26000 per year for an income of about 50 000 rupees per month
[506.20 - 511.80]  should something happen. So this is what you can see from the pricing that yes this one is priced
[511.80 - 516.28]  quite competitively right even compared to the DG Shield plan. Correct. And in case if I were
[516.28 - 522.84]  to increase the age of the individual to 35 from 25 what was 9000 change would now become 14000.
[523.64 - 529.80]  The DG Shield which used to be 11 would be about 15-16 and the income plan which is about 25 000
[529.80 - 535.88]  earlier is now looking at about 28-29 000. So more or less a proportion increase nothing significant
[535.88 - 542.20]  sort of stands out here. Alright so now in terms of the recommendations that we have at the you
[542.20 - 548.92]  know max life HDFC life so how are the premiums priced based on that. So once again let me give
[548.92 - 555.72]  it you with an example of the same profile a 25 year old one crore plan till 65. The DG Shield
[555.80 - 563.24]  plan was about 11500-1600. The salary term plan was about 9500 or so. This is the benchmark we've
[563.24 - 568.04]  set for Atia Birla. Coming to max life they're reasonably priced quite close somewhere about
[568.04 - 576.20]  10100 a year. ICIC is a bit higher at about 10900 and HDFC is even more expensive than the DG Shield
[576.20 - 581.48]  plan they're about 11900. So I think yeah this is what it would compare like you can see they're
[581.48 - 586.68]  quite competitive nothing really stands out or no added advantage either. So they're offering
[586.68 - 591.08]  similar prices but they're also you know competing with some of the largest players out there in the
[591.08 - 598.60]  industry. Alright so finally what's the final word on Atia Birla's and life insurance. So I
[598.60 - 603.16]  think based on our analysis they really do stand out as a solid player right like we just looked
[603.16 - 606.60]  at in terms of pricing as well they're able to compete with some of the large players out there.
[607.40 - 611.56]  In terms of features they're quite comprehensive they offer the accident plans, their waiver of
[611.56 - 616.52]  premium coverage, critical illness all the benefits right that are generally available out there.
[616.52 - 621.40]  Coming to the operational metrics like we saw complaint volume as well was quite low in fact
[621.40 - 626.36]  lower than even some of these brands at about five complaints every 10 000. So honestly from
[626.36 - 630.92]  that front no complaints or no issues as such. The only thing I would say is that yes there is
[630.92 - 635.88]  smaller player when compared to the top three or top five out there. So that's something that's
[635.88 - 639.96]  up to user right whether he wishes to take that risk or would he want more peace of mind going
[639.96 - 644.04]  with one of the larger established players out there. Understood. But other than that nothing
[644.04 - 648.28]  against them they really are a good option available. That's great that's a that's a good
[648.28 - 654.92]  insight Sushant and thank you so much for going into detail of Atia Birla's and life insurance.
