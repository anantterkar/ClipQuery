1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,080
 You know insurance covers hospital bills, but what if you don't want allopathy?

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:07,920
 What if you prefer Ayurveda, homeopathy or naturopathy?

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:09,400
 Can insurance still help you?

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:12,440
 Yes, but only if you understand how Ayush coverage works.

5
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:21,320

7
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,880
 covered under your health insurance policy.

8
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:31,720
 And if you're considering alternative treatments and want to check if your policy supports

9

 it, book a free call with Ditto.

10
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:34,920
 We'll help you figure it out.

11
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:38,120
 The link is in the description and our services are completely free to you.

12
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:40,160
 So first, what is Ayush?

13
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:46,440
 Ayush stands for Ayurveda, Yoga, Naturopathy, Yunani, Siddha and Homeopathy.

14
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:47,560
 Ayush.

15
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:52,100
 These are India's officially recognised alternative medical systems, supported by the Ministry

16
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:53,440
 of Ayush.

17
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:57,540
 And yes, they are covered under most comprehensive health insurance plans today.

18
00:00:57,540 --> 00:00:59,180
 How did this become standard?

19
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:00,180
 You might be wondering.

20
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:05,900
 IIDI made it mandatory for insurers to include Ayush benefits in group and individual policies.

21
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:10,280
 Since then, most retail health plans have included it as a built-in feature.

22
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,860
 But here's the fine print.

23
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:17,200
 To claim Ayush treatments, the hospital must be recognised by the government or accredited

24
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,860
 by NABH or NABL.

25
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:23,240
 The treatment must be inpatient and medically necessary.

26
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:28,840
 The hospital should have at least five beds, a qualified Ayush doctor and maintain daily

27
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,480
 treatment records.

28
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:33,280
 So under Ayush, what is covered?

29
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:39,480
 Ayurveda detox therapies, which is also called as panchakarma, homeopathy for chronic conditions,

30
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:45,920
 Siddha or Yunani treatments, naturopathy and yoga, but only when done as a part of a recognised

31
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,400
 inpatient programme.

32
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,880
 Now what is not covered in Ayush?

33
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:57,080
 OPD consultations at local clinics, spa treatments, wellness retreats or casual yoga sessions,

34
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:03,040
 any Ayush therapy done at an uncertified centre, cosmetic, experimental or recreational use

35
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,040
 of Ayush.

36
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,320
 Well, these are not allowed.

37
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,000
 Some policies may also cap Ayush expenses.

38
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,680
 For example, they may limit claims to 25% of your sum insured or up to 50,000 rupees.

39
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:19,060
 But many new age plans cover Ayush up to the base full sum insured.

40
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:21,120
 When is Ayush actually useful?

41
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:26,380
 Managing chronic illnesses like asthma, arthritis or psoriasis, detox and long-term lifestyle

42
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:30,900
 correction, pain relief and rehabilitation after surgery.

43
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:34,300
 And when you're looking for a non-allopathic route to wellness.

44
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:36,420
 Now here are some ditto pro tips.

45
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:40,100
 Always confirm hospital accreditation before admission.

46
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:43,620
 Keep all prescriptions, discharge summaries and bills.

47
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:48,340
 Check with your insurer if cashless is possible or go in for reimbursement later.

48
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:50,060
 Now what's the final word?

49
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:55,160
 It empowers policyholders with more treatment choices, particularly for chronic, long-term

50
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:59,260
 or non-emergency conditions through recognised alternative therapies.

51
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:03,780
 However, to fully benefit from this feature, one must clearly understand the eligibility

52
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:08,900
 criteria, policy limits and the requirement for treatments to be conducted in accredited

53
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:10,500
 Ayush facilities.

54
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:15,140
 And folks, it's also important to note that Ayush claims may undergo more detailed scrutiny.

55
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:19,460
 Even the relatively uncommon and specialised nature of such treatments within insurance

56
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:20,460
 portfolios.

57
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:26,060
 Anyways, which, if you still want help choosing whether your current policy covers Ayush or

58
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:29,100
 want to compare plans that do, book a free call with ditto.

59
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,980
 We'll walk you through it.

60
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:34,780
 And folks, in the next episode, we'll cover maternity benefits and explain when and how

61
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:37,900
 much your policy will actually pay.

62
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:42,240
 If you liked this video, please share it with someone who's getting an Ayush treatment soon

63
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,960
 and I will see you in the next one.

00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,520
 Until then, happy insurance hunting.
