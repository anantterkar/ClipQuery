[0.00 - 5.08] You know insurance covers hospital bills but what if you don't want alopathy?
[5.08 - 7.88] What if you prefer Ayurveda, Homeopathy or naturopathy?
[7.88 - 9.36] Can insurance still help you?
[9.36 - 13.84] Yes, but only if you understand how Irish coverage works.
[13.84 - 21.32] Hello everyone, I am Shishank and you are watching the Two Insurance.
[21.32 - 25.52] In today's episode of Health Insurance 101, we are explaining how Irish treatments are
[25.52 - 27.88] covered under your health insurance policy.
[27.88 - 32.28] And if you are considering alternative treatments and want to check if your policy supports it,
[32.28 - 33.68] look if you call with ditto.
[33.68 - 34.92] We will help you figure it out.
[34.92 - 38.12] The link is in the description and our services are completely free to you.
[38.12 - 40.24] So first, what is Irish?
[40.24 - 46.52] Irish stands for Ayurveda, Yoga, naturopathy, Yunani, Siddha and Homeopathy.
[46.52 - 47.52] Irish.
[47.52 - 52.36] These are India's officially recognized alternative medical systems supported by Ministry of
[52.36 - 53.36] Irish.
[53.36 - 57.56] And yes, they are covered under most comprehensive health insurance plans today.
[57.56 - 59.20] How did this become standard?
[59.20 - 60.52] You might be wondering.
[60.52 - 65.88] IIDI made it mandatory for insurance to include Irish benefits in group and individual policies.
[65.88 - 70.32] Since then, most retail health plans have included it as a built-in feature.
[70.32 - 71.88] But here is the fine print.
[71.88 - 77.20] To claim Irish treatments, the hospital must be recognized by the government or accredited
[77.20 - 79.88] by NAVH or NABL.
[79.88 - 83.28] The treatment must be inpatient and medically necessary.
[83.28 - 88.88] The hospital should have at least five beds, a qualified Irish doctor and maintain daily
[88.88 - 90.52] treatment records.
[90.52 - 93.48] So under Irish, what is covered?
[93.48 - 100.72] Irish is called as Panchakarma, homeopathy for chronic conditions, Siddha or Yunani
[100.72 - 106.60] treatments, naturopathy and yoga, but only when done as a part of a recognized inpatient
[106.60 - 107.60] program.
[107.60 - 109.88] So, what is not covered in Irish?
[109.88 - 117.08] OPD consultations at local clinics, spa treatments, wellness retreats or casual yoga sessions,
[117.08 - 122.76] any Irish therapy done at an uncertified centre, cosmetic, experimental or recreational
[122.76 - 126.32] use of Irish, while these are not allowed.
[126.32 - 129.00] Some policies may also cap Irish expenses.
[129.00 - 134.68] For example, they may limit claims to 25% of your sum in short or up to 50,000 rupees.
[134.68 - 139.04] Many NewH plans cover Irish up to the base full sum in short.
[139.04 - 141.04] When is Irish actually useful?
[141.04 - 146.36] Managing chronic illnesses like asthma, arthritis or psoriasis, detox and long term lifestyle
[146.36 - 151.88] correction, pain relief and rehabilitation after surgery and when you're looking for
[151.88 - 154.04] a non-allopathic root to illness.
[154.04 - 156.64] Now, here are some ditto pro tips.
[156.64 - 160.08] Always confirm hospital accreditation before admission.
[160.08 - 163.52] Keep all prescriptions, discharge summaries and bills.
[163.52 - 168.32] Check with your insurer if cashless is possible or going for reimbursement later.
[168.32 - 170.04] Now what's the final word?
[170.04 - 175.16] It empowers policy holders with more treatment choices, particularly for chronic, long term
[175.16 - 179.24] or non-imagency conditions through recognized alternative therapies.
[179.24 - 183.76] However, to fully benefit from this feature, one must clearly understand the eligibility
[183.76 - 188.84] criteria, policy limits and the requirement for treatments to be conducted in accredited
[188.84 - 190.52] Irish facilities.
[190.52 - 194.88] And folks, it's also important to note that Irish claims may undergo more detailed scrutiny,
[194.88 - 199.48] given the relatively uncommon and specialized nature of such treatments within insurance
[199.48 - 200.48] portfolios.
[200.48 - 205.52] Anyways, which, if you still want help choosing whether your current policy covers Irish
[205.52 - 209.36] or want to compare plans that do, book a free call with ditto.
