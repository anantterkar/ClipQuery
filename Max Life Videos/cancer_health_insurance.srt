00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,760
 Hi, I'm Shashank and today we're discussing a crucial topic that affects millions of families

2
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:09,760
 across India.

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,360
 Cancer and insurance coverage.

4
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:16,280

 So head to the link in the description and book your free chat with our advisors.

9
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,320
 Let me take you through some statistics.

10
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:38,480
 The numbers tell a sobering story about cancer's impact in our country.

11
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:43,880
 This translates to roughly 100 people out of every 1 lakh receiving this life-changing

12
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:44,880
 diagnosis.

13
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:49,560
 Even more concerning is that 1 in 9 Indians will develop cancer during their lifetime.

14
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:54,040
 Looking at specific demographics, lung cancer predominantly affects our male population,

15
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:56,800
 while breast cancer remains the most common among women.

16
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:02,960
 For children aged 0-14 years, lymphoid leukemia possesses the greatest threat.

17
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,680
 Cancer has become the second leading cause of death in India, accounting for 18.1% of

18
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:13,160
 all deaths and experts project a 12.8% increase in cases by 2025.

19
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:15,960
 Let's talk about what this means for insurance coverage.

20
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:20,640
 While most health insurance policies in India now cover cancer diagnoses that occur after

21
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:26,360
 policy purchase, the situation becomes significantly more complicated for those already diagnosed

22
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,120
 Here's the harsh reality.

23
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:32,720
 Obtaining a comprehensive personal health insurance plan after a cancer diagnosis is

24
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,320
 nearly impossible.

25
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:40,320
 Insurance companies view these cases as high-risk due to increased likelihood of hospitalization

26
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,320
 and frequent treatments.

27
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:45,600
 It's crucial to understand that concealing a cancer diagnosis isn't an option.

28
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:50,120
 Such a nondisclosure is considered fraud and can result in claim denials, policy cancellation

29
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,920
 and loss of all paid premiums.

30
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,960
 However, there are several paths forward for those already diagnosed with cancer.

31
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:02,400
 The Aishman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Aarogya Yojana, that is PMJAY, offers hope for eligible

32
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:05,520
 low-income families and senior citizens over 70.

33
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,840
 The scheme covers cancer treatment without considering it a pre-existing condition.

34
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,000
 Many states also offer their own healthcare schemes.

35
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,680
 For instance, Maharashtra's MPJAY provides free coverage up to 5 lakhs for state residents,

36
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,720
 though the quality of care and hospital networks may be limited.

37
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,640
 Let's dive deep into insurance options available for cancer patients and survivors.

38
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,640
 Group health insurance offers one of the most promising paths for cancer patients.

39
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,640
 Here's why.

40
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,880
 Now, if you're employed, your employer's group health insurance policy could be your

41
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:33,920
 strongest ally.

42
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,560
 These corporate policies typically offer several advantages.

43
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:41,800
 Immediate coverage for pre-existing conditions, including cancer, no waiting periods for treatment,

44
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:46,480
 more comprehensive coverage compared to individual policies and often includes family members

45
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,960
 under the same policy.

46
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:51,120
 But employment isn't the only way to access group insurance.

47
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,640
 Consider these alternative sources.

48
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:56,240
 Program-based group insurance programs like college, alumni associations, professional

49
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,000
 organizations and trade groups.

50
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,400
 These group policies generally feature more flexible underwriting guidelines.

51
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:04,880
 They're more likely to accommodate pre-existing conditions also.

52
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:08,560
 Coverage terms may vary, but they often provide essential benefits.

53
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:13,840
 Now, moving on, STAR Health's Cancer Care Platinum is one of the few specialized policies

54
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,600
 designed specifically for cancer patients.

55
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,880
 Let's examine the features and limitations in detail.

56
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:24,440
 Key features are it has comprehensive cancer specific benefits and it's available even

57
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,440
 after diagnosis.

58
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,200
 However, there are important considerations to understand.

59
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:32,600
 It has mandatory copayment structure, which is required for all policyholders age 61 and

60
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,600
 above.

61
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,960
 This means sharing a portion of every medical expense.

62
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:39,720
 There are some coverage restrictions here as well, like no restriction benefits after

63
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:40,720
 claim.

64
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:46,720
 Once you use your coverage, it doesn't reset and low no claim bonus of only 5% with maximum

65
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,360
 bonus cap at 50%.

66
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:53,160
 Despite these drawbacks, STAR Cancer Care Platinum remains a popular choice primarily

67
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:55,560
 due to the scarcity of alternatives in the market.

68
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:59,080
 However, there's a room for improvement in their operational performance and customer

69
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,080
 service.

70
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,440
 Now, Care Freedom Plan.

71
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:06,520
 The Care Freedom Plan presents a unique option for those in remission, but it comes with

72
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:10,400
 specific conditions and limitations which are the policyholder must be in remission

73
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:15,440
 for more than two years and must have clean health record aside from the cancer history.

74
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,080
 But it comes with its own limitation.

75
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:21,560
 Permanent exclusion of cancer related conditions, copayment requirements for hospitalization

76
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,680
 are some of these.

77
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:26,360
 Now, some of the things that you might want to consider is because of multiple pre-existing

78
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,160
 conditions it may lead to rejection.

79
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,240
 So this should be considered as a last resort option.

80
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:34,560
 This plan can help cover non-cancer related medical expenses.

81
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,080
 Now onto public sector insurance companies.

82
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:42,520
 Public sector insurance companies offer another avenue for coverage, including New India Assurance,

83
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:45,320
 United India Insurance and Oriental Insurance.

84
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:48,480
 These insurers might provide coverage under specific conditions.

85
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:51,680
 Person must be in complete remission for at least two years.

86
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,240
 They must have medical documentation of recovery along with clear follow-up reports.

87
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,520
 However, be aware of these factors.

88
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,440
 Coverage is typically not comprehensive.

89
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,720
 Claim processes can be challenging.

90
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:05,720
 Customer service may not be as good as the private sector standards.

91
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:10,640
 There is limited digital infrastructure and processing time may take longer than usual.

92
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:14,920
 Now that we covered cancer from the perspective of health insurance, let's switch the focus

93
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:20,400
 Now regarding life insurance, the situation mirrors health insurance.

94
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,840
 Because while existing policies will honour claims of cancerous diagnosed after purchase,

95
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:28,720
 obtaining new coverage after diagnosis becomes extremely challenging.

96
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:33,160
 Again, there is a small window of opportunity after two to three years of complete remission.

97
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:38,040
 During this time, individuals might consider smaller sum insured endowment or money-backed policies.

98
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:42,120
 While these come with higher premiums, they can provide some level of coverage.

99
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:45,920
 The message we need to take away from today is both urgent and clear.

100
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:51,280
 Securing comprehensive health and term life insurance while in good health isn't just a financial decision.

101
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,720
 It's a crucial step in protecting your family's future.

102
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:58,440
 Cancer doesn't just affect our health, it affects and devastates our financial stability.

103
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:03,360
 To every viewer watching this video who has been affected by cancer either personally or through a loved one,

 we understand the overwhelming nature of both medical and financial challenges you're facing.

00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:12,520
 And to those who are healthy today, let this be your wake-up call.

107
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:17,520

108
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,120
