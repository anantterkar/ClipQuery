[0.00 - 8.76]  Hi, I'm Shashank and today we're discussing a crucial topic that affects millions of families
[8.76 - 9.76]  across India.
[9.76 - 11.36]  Cancer and insurance coverage.
[11.36 - 16.28]  Before we begin, I want to introduce you to Ditto, your trusted insurance advisory platform.
[16.28 - 20.52]  We're backed by XeroDha and have 10,000 plus reviews on Google.
[20.52 - 24.76]  At Ditto, we believe everyone deserves access to transparent, unbiased insurance guidance,
[24.76 - 27.36]  especially when dealing with serious health conditions.
[27.36 - 31.32]  So head to the link in the description and book your free chat with our advisors.
[31.32 - 33.32]  Let me take you through some statistics.
[33.32 - 38.48]  The numbers tell a sobering story about cancer's impact in our country.
[38.48 - 43.88]  This translates to roughly 100 people out of every 1 lakh receiving this life-changing
[43.88 - 44.88]  diagnosis.
[44.88 - 49.56]  Even more concerning is that 1 in 9 Indians will develop cancer during their lifetime.
[49.56 - 54.04]  Looking at specific demographics, lung cancer predominantly affects our male population,
[54.04 - 56.80]  while breast cancer remains the most common among women.
[56.92 - 62.96]  For children aged 0-14 years, lymphoid leukemia possesses the greatest threat.
[62.96 - 67.68]  Cancer has become the second leading cause of death in India, accounting for 18.1% of
[67.68 - 73.16]  all deaths and experts project a 12.8% increase in cases by 2025.
[73.16 - 75.96]  Let's talk about what this means for insurance coverage.
[75.96 - 80.64]  While most health insurance policies in India now cover cancer diagnoses that occur after
[80.64 - 86.36]  policy purchase, the situation becomes significantly more complicated for those already diagnosed
[87.12 - 88.12]  Here's the harsh reality.
[88.12 - 92.72]  Obtaining a comprehensive personal health insurance plan after a cancer diagnosis is
[92.72 - 95.32]  nearly impossible.
[95.32 - 100.32]  Insurance companies view these cases as high-risk due to increased likelihood of hospitalization
[100.32 - 101.32]  and frequent treatments.
[101.32 - 105.60]  It's crucial to understand that concealing a cancer diagnosis isn't an option.
[105.60 - 110.12]  Such a nondisclosure is considered fraud and can result in claim denials, policy cancellation
[110.12 - 111.92]  and loss of all paid premiums.
[111.92 - 115.96]  However, there are several paths forward for those already diagnosed with cancer.
[116.64 - 122.40]  The Aishman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Aarogya Yojana, that is PMJAY, offers hope for eligible
[122.40 - 125.52]  low-income families and senior citizens over 70.
[125.52 - 129.84]  The scheme covers cancer treatment without considering it a pre-existing condition.
[129.84 - 132.00]  Many states also offer their own healthcare schemes.
[132.00 - 137.68]  For instance, Maharashtra's MPJAY provides free coverage up to 5 lakhs for state residents,
[137.68 - 140.72]  though the quality of care and hospital networks may be limited.
[140.72 - 144.64]  Let's dive deep into insurance options available for cancer patients and survivors.
[144.64 - 148.64]  Group health insurance offers one of the most promising paths for cancer patients.
[148.64 - 149.64]  Here's why.
[149.64 - 152.88]  Now, if you're employed, your employer's group health insurance policy could be your
[152.88 - 153.92]  strongest ally.
[153.92 - 157.56]  These corporate policies typically offer several advantages.
[157.56 - 161.80]  Immediate coverage for pre-existing conditions, including cancer, no waiting periods for treatment,
[161.80 - 166.48]  more comprehensive coverage compared to individual policies and often includes family members
[166.48 - 167.96]  under the same policy.
[167.96 - 171.12]  But employment isn't the only way to access group insurance.
[171.12 - 172.64]  Consider these alternative sources.
[172.64 - 176.24]  Program-based group insurance programs like college, alumni associations, professional
[176.24 - 178.00]  organizations and trade groups.
[178.00 - 181.40]  These group policies generally feature more flexible underwriting guidelines.
[181.40 - 184.88]  They're more likely to accommodate pre-existing conditions also.
[184.88 - 188.56]  Coverage terms may vary, but they often provide essential benefits.
[188.56 - 193.84]  Now, moving on, STAR Health's Cancer Care Platinum is one of the few specialized policies
[193.84 - 196.60]  designed specifically for cancer patients.
[196.60 - 198.88]  Let's examine the features and limitations in detail.
[198.96 - 204.44]  Key features are it has comprehensive cancer specific benefits and it's available even
[204.44 - 205.44]  after diagnosis.
[205.44 - 208.20]  However, there are important considerations to understand.
[208.20 - 212.60]  It has mandatory copayment structure, which is required for all policyholders age 61 and
[212.60 - 213.60]  above.
[213.60 - 215.96]  This means sharing a portion of every medical expense.
[215.96 - 219.72]  There are some coverage restrictions here as well, like no restriction benefits after
[219.72 - 220.72]  claim.
[220.72 - 226.72]  Once you use your coverage, it doesn't reset and low no claim bonus of only 5% with maximum
[226.72 - 228.36]  bonus cap at 50%.
[228.36 - 233.16]  Despite these drawbacks, STAR Cancer Care Platinum remains a popular choice primarily
[233.16 - 235.56]  due to the scarcity of alternatives in the market.
[235.56 - 239.08]  However, there's a room for improvement in their operational performance and customer
[239.08 - 240.08]  service.
[240.08 - 241.44]  Now, Care Freedom Plan.
[241.44 - 246.52]  The Care Freedom Plan presents a unique option for those in remission, but it comes with
[246.52 - 250.40]  specific conditions and limitations which are the policyholder must be in remission
[250.40 - 255.44]  for more than two years and must have clean health record aside from the cancer history.
[255.44 - 257.08]  But it comes with its own limitation.
[257.08 - 261.56]  Permanent exclusion of cancer related conditions, copayment requirements for hospitalization
[261.56 - 262.68]  are some of these.
[262.68 - 266.36]  Now, some of the things that you might want to consider is because of multiple pre-existing
[266.36 - 268.16]  conditions it may lead to rejection.
[268.16 - 271.24]  So this should be considered as a last resort option.
[271.24 - 274.56]  This plan can help cover non-cancer related medical expenses.
[274.56 - 277.08]  Now onto public sector insurance companies.
[277.08 - 282.52]  Public sector insurance companies offer another avenue for coverage, including New India Assurance,
[282.52 - 285.32]  United India Insurance and Oriental Insurance.
[285.32 - 288.48]  These insurers might provide coverage under specific conditions.
[288.48 - 291.68]  Person must be in complete remission for at least two years.
[291.68 - 295.24]  They must have medical documentation of recovery along with clear follow-up reports.
[295.24 - 297.52]  However, be aware of these factors.
[297.52 - 299.44]  Coverage is typically not comprehensive.
[299.44 - 301.72]  Claim processes can be challenging.
[301.72 - 305.72]  Customer service may not be as good as the private sector standards.
[305.72 - 310.64]  There is limited digital infrastructure and processing time may take longer than usual.
[310.64 - 314.92]  Now that we covered cancer from the perspective of health insurance, let's switch the focus
[315.92 - 320.40]  Now regarding life insurance, the situation mirrors health insurance.
[320.40 - 324.84]  Because while existing policies will honour claims of cancerous diagnosed after purchase,
[324.84 - 328.72]  obtaining new coverage after diagnosis becomes extremely challenging.
[328.72 - 333.16]  Again, there is a small window of opportunity after two to three years of complete remission.
[333.16 - 338.04]  During this time, individuals might consider smaller sum insured endowment or money-backed policies.
[338.04 - 342.12]  While these come with higher premiums, they can provide some level of coverage.
[342.20 - 345.92]  The message we need to take away from today is both urgent and clear.
[345.92 - 351.28]  Securing comprehensive health and term life insurance while in good health isn't just a financial decision.
[351.28 - 353.72]  It's a crucial step in protecting your family's future.
[353.72 - 358.44]  Cancer doesn't just affect our health, it affects and devastates our financial stability.
