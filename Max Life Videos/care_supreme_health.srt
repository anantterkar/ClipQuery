00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,500
 Now, let's start with a quick snapshot of the insurer.

12
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:43,420
 Care Health Insurance, formerly known as Religare, is a standalone health insurer launched in 2012.

13

 Now, their claim settlement ratio averages at 90% with an incurred claim ratio of 59%

15
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:57,920
 and they've got a hospital network of over 11,400 hospitals across India.

16
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:00,560
 Now, let's dive into the actual plan that is CareSupreme.

17
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:02,180

00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:16,400
 You can buy it as an individual plan or as a family floater

24
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,260

00:01:49,291 --> 00:01:53,131

31
00:01:53,131 --> 00:01:57,311
 features of Care Supreme. You get unlimited restoration triggered on partial or complete

32
00:01:57,311 --> 00:02:02,411

33
00:02:02,411 --> 00:02:07,471
 a policy year no matter how many claims you make. The bonus structure is also very strong. You get

34
00:02:07,471 --> 00:02:12,391
 50% bonus per year up to a max of 100% of your base sum insured and here's the kicker,

35
00:02:12,671 --> 00:02:17,051
 this bonus is retained even if you claim, that is very rare. But it gets better with

36
00:02:17,051 --> 00:02:22,871
 cumulative bonus super add-on which lets your base sum insured grow by 100% per year up to 500%

37
00:02:22,871 --> 00:02:28,011
 max and even better, this bonus never reduces even after claims. Now let's talk about the

38
00:02:28,011 --> 00:02:33,171
 waiting periods. Initial waiting period is 30 days except for accidents, specific illness waiting

00:02:33,171 --> 00:02:38,591

00:03:08,391 --> 00:03:13,111

47
00:03:13,111 --> 00:03:15,391

67
00:04:46,303 --> 00:04:51,863
 What does it actually cost? Now here are a few profiles on your screen. All premiums are inclusive

68
00:04:51,863 --> 00:04:57,663
 of GST and 5% digital discount and you can feel free to pause as well and take a look at the premium chart.

69
00:05:01,003 --> 00:05:20,034
 Now let talk about the premium structure and honestly this is one of the most smartest parts of the Care Supreme plan Unlike a lot of plans where the low premium is just bait and you discover restrictions later here the pricing actually reflects real usable features The base premium includes all essential covers and then you have the flexibility to add or skip certain

70
00:05:20,034 --> 00:05:24,834
 benefits based on your life stage. For young buyers, this works beautifully. You can get a

71
00:05:24,834 --> 00:05:30,034
 one crore cover at under 19,000 a year with bonus boosters and air ambulance included, which is

72
00:05:30,034 --> 00:05:36,034
 practically unmatched. That said, for older age groups, say above 60, the premium jumps sharply.

73
00:05:36,034 --> 00:05:40,594
 And in many cases, Care mandates certain add-ons like Wellness or Air Ambulance depending on your

74
00:05:40,594 --> 00:05:45,314
 age, which limits how much you can strip down the cost. But overall, if you're in your 20s to early

75
00:05:45,314 --> 00:05:50,434
 40s, Care Supreme is aggressively priced without cutting corners and that's rare in health insurance.

76
00:05:50,434 --> 00:05:56,034
 So, what's the conclusion? Care Supreme is a genuinely impressive plan. Flexible, customizable

77
00:05:56,034 --> 00:06:00,974
 and extremely value-driven. It gives you strong base features, no caps or hidden restrictions,

78
00:06:01,274 --> 00:06:05,354
 and the kind of restoration and bonus structure that rivals even premium price plans. Yes,

79
00:06:05,454 --> 00:06:09,454
 there are some limitations like slightly higher complaint volumes and mandatory add-ons for some

80
00:06:09,454 --> 00:06:14,514
 people, but overall, it's one of the best balanced plans in the market today. It works especially

81
00:06:14,514 --> 00:06:19,414
 well for young buyers in their 20s and 30s, families who want strong coverage with affordability,

82
00:06:19,814 --> 00:06:23,974
 anyone with pre-existing conditions who want shorter wait times. So folks, if you're still

83
00:06:23,974 --> 00:06:27,974
