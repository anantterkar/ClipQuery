[291.86 - 297.66]  of GST and 5% digital discount and you can feel free to pause as well and take a look at the premium chart.
[301.00 - 320.03]  Now let talk about the premium structure and honestly this is one of the most smartest parts of the Care Supreme plan Unlike a lot of plans where the low premium is just bait and you discover restrictions later here the pricing actually reflects real usable features The base premium includes all essential covers and then you have the flexibility to add or skip certain
[320.03 - 324.83]  benefits based on your life stage. For young buyers, this works beautifully. You can get a
[324.83 - 330.03]  one crore cover at under 19,000 a year with bonus boosters and air ambulance included, which is
[330.03 - 336.03]  practically unmatched. That said, for older age groups, say above 60, the premium jumps sharply.
[336.03 - 340.59]  And in many cases, Care mandates certain add-ons like Wellness or Air Ambulance depending on your
[340.59 - 345.31]  age, which limits how much you can strip down the cost. But overall, if you're in your 20s to early
[345.31 - 350.43]  40s, Care Supreme is aggressively priced without cutting corners and that's rare in health insurance.
[350.43 - 356.03]  So, what's the conclusion? Care Supreme is a genuinely impressive plan. Flexible, customizable
[356.03 - 360.97]  and extremely value-driven. It gives you strong base features, no caps or hidden restrictions,
[361.27 - 365.35]  and the kind of restoration and bonus structure that rivals even premium price plans. Yes,
[365.45 - 369.45]  there are some limitations like slightly higher complaint volumes and mandatory add-ons for some
[369.45 - 374.51]  people, but overall, it's one of the best balanced plans in the market today. It works especially
[374.51 - 379.41]  well for young buyers in their 20s and 30s, families who want strong coverage with affordability,
[379.81 - 383.97]  anyone with pre-existing conditions who want shorter wait times. So folks, if you're still
