00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,200
 Hi folks, welcome to Ditto Insurance. I am Shashank, your host, and joining me is our

2
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:14,240
 senior advisor, Supreet. Hey, good to be here. Supreet here has advised 4,000 people. Thank

3
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:18,940
 you so much for being here. Now, Supreet, let me tell you this. You guys have always

4
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:23,680
 told me that get a term insurance because it is beneficial for your family if something

5
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:30,500
 happens in a longer run agreed I get a term insurance now I am the one who's paying the

6
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:38,320
 premium every year say 10-15,000 every year it's financially a burden for me man okay and

7
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:44,500
 I wanted to see if there is an investment opportunity wherein I could get some money

8
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:50,020
 back and make the term insurance work for me so what I did was I went on and searched

9
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:58,880
 any such policies that exist and one thing that pop up was money back policy now money back policy

10
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:08,020
 seemed like a really great option because i get periodic payouts of x amount and also my

11
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:15,240
 family is insured now this sounds like a great plan is there any reason why you as a financial

12
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:20,560
 advisor would say no don't go in for money back not just money back plans i think you can add few

13
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:27,520
 more plans in the list okay your lip endowment okay return on premium plans okay uh so the thing

14
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:32,640
 with these plans is they focus more on the return aspect okay now as an individual i would like to

15
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:40,300
 ask you now what is your primary focus i want to cover my family so that when if i'm not around

16
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:54,324
 they are insured they have enough money to live the way that they have been living with the current expense that we are incurring and adjusting to the future inflation they still covered Right So basically protection

17
00:01:54,324 --> 00:01:55,324
 Yes.

18
00:01:55,324 --> 00:01:59,024
 So if you are looking for protection, then choose an instrument that is purely giving

19
00:01:59,024 --> 00:02:04,704
 you that protection aspect, which is the term plan, where the premiums are lesser and you

20
00:02:04,704 --> 00:02:08,804
 can choose a higher cover amount and you said 10, 15,000.

21
00:02:08,804 --> 00:02:12,844
 that's closely around 1000-1500 rupees per month.

22
00:02:13,484 --> 00:02:13,924
 Right?

23
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:16,644
 I don't think in today's world that should be burdening.

24
00:02:16,724 --> 00:02:18,384
 I think it's a couple of Zomato's bill anyway.

25
00:02:18,864 --> 00:02:19,044
 Right?

26
00:02:19,104 --> 00:02:19,624
 What do you think?

27
00:02:19,924 --> 00:02:20,524
 Right, right.

28
00:02:20,764 --> 00:02:22,844
 Now, you brought in the math here.

29
00:02:23,284 --> 00:02:27,284
 Help me break down money back's math.

30
00:02:27,604 --> 00:02:28,564
 Like, how does it work?

31
00:02:29,184 --> 00:02:29,424
 Right.

32
00:02:29,564 --> 00:02:30,804
 Let's take an example, right?

33
00:02:30,904 --> 00:02:33,404
 Now, let's say you have a money back plan.

34
00:02:33,704 --> 00:02:36,004
 You're paying a premium of around 50K.

35
00:02:36,224 --> 00:02:36,444
 Okay.

36
00:02:36,444 --> 00:02:42,684
 your sum insured is 10 lakh all right now keeping the return aspect aside first fall the question

37
00:02:42,684 --> 00:02:50,424
 is is 10 lakh enough to cover your family in your absence doing the math if suppose my expenses 50,000

38
00:02:50,424 --> 00:02:58,444
 now it can grow to 1 lakh say in 5 or 10 years now right and 12 months it becomes 12 lakhs I have

39
00:02:58,444 --> 00:03:03,684
 already exceeded that 10 lakh right yeah so not even one years of expenses in my opinion right

40
00:03:03,684 --> 00:03:08,644
 So, in order to chase that what do you do in order to correct it you try to get a higher

41
00:03:08,644 --> 00:03:10,164
 cover in the same plan.

42
00:03:10,164 --> 00:03:11,164
 Correct.

43
00:03:11,164 --> 00:03:14,444
 And then you end up paying lakhs in premiums towards it.

44
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:15,444
 Okay.

45
00:03:15,444 --> 00:03:19,064
 Now when you look at the investment component of the same plan now when you calculate the

46
00:03:19,064 --> 00:03:23,604
 return on investment it is not even close to any of your SIPs today.

47
00:03:23,604 --> 00:03:29,424
 So the advice is now keep your insurance product different keep your investment product different

48
00:03:29,424 --> 00:03:31,604
 let there not be any conflict.

49
00:03:31,604 --> 00:03:43,568
 So the advantage of doing so while choosing your term plan you can choose a higher cover that is tailor made for you based on your expenses and when you thinking investment maybe you can choose a

50
00:03:43,568 --> 00:03:46,648
 pure investment instrument like say mutual funds or something.

51
00:03:46,648 --> 00:03:53,748
 But money back policy offers a periodic payout in five year gaps.

52
00:03:53,748 --> 00:04:02,568
 Now I read about this breakdown where suppose if I have a 65,000 annual premium I am insured

53
00:04:02,568 --> 00:04:09,968
 for 10 lakh rupees, right? And every five years, I get 15-20% of the sum insured which is one and

54
00:04:09,968 --> 00:04:15,628
 a half lakh every five years. Now, don't you think that I can use that one and a half lakh rupees

55
00:04:15,628 --> 00:04:21,108
 for my short term financial goals? You can. I mean, if you're looking at it from an investment

56
00:04:21,108 --> 00:04:27,108
 point of view, maybe it makes sense. But my question is, are you looking at it from an

57
00:04:27,108 --> 00:04:31,408
 insurance point of view? So what is the sum assured associated with that? Right. Again,

58
00:04:31,408 --> 00:04:36,648
 we circle back to the same thing that the cover isn't enough and the premiums, right?

59
00:04:36,648 --> 00:04:42,728
 So we want to compare and contrast maybe with our best plan that we suggest everyone and

60
00:04:42,728 --> 00:04:44,428
 a random money back policy.

61
00:04:44,428 --> 00:04:46,968
 So how do the premiums compare against each other?

62
00:04:46,968 --> 00:04:47,968
 Right.

63
00:04:47,968 --> 00:04:48,968
 Let me take your own example.

64
00:04:48,968 --> 00:04:51,688
 You mentioned 65K premium, right?

65
00:04:51,688 --> 00:04:57,988
 So if you want to break it down, you can probably dedicate 10, 15,000, which can get you about

66
00:04:57,988 --> 00:05:01,348
 a crore cover and the rest, you can invest it.

67
00:05:01,348 --> 00:05:08,848
 You can have an investment specific product and you can expect a return of say 10-12%

68
00:05:08,848 --> 00:05:14,528
 on your good days and I think this strategy would be much better than trying to get both

69
00:05:14,528 --> 00:05:17,448
 these components into one single product.

70
00:05:17,448 --> 00:05:20,728
 You don't get the best of either worlds end of the day.

71
00:05:20,728 --> 00:05:37,713
 Understood So finally what does Ditto recommend So we here at Ditto we advise on insurance right So we look at all the products from the insurance point of view Right Thereby recommending a term plan a pure term plan instead of these plans where there is a return component

72
00:05:38,153 --> 00:05:38,493
 Understood.

73
00:05:38,493 --> 00:05:49,433
 In fact, even in term insurance, there are return on premium add-ons that are available wherein you can pay in slightly higher premiums and get those options added.

74
00:05:49,653 --> 00:05:49,853
 Okay.

75
00:05:49,853 --> 00:05:54,693
 If you call Ditto, I think the first thing they would say is, please don't go for that.

76
00:05:55,373 --> 00:05:56,593
 I mean, it's easy to sell.

77
00:05:56,993 --> 00:06:02,512
 It's easy to say that, hey, you know, if you're not here, your insurance cover reaches your family.

78
00:06:02,773 --> 00:06:02,973
 Correct.

79
00:06:03,193 --> 00:06:05,733
 But if you survive, you get some money back, right?

80
00:06:05,813 --> 00:06:07,973
 I can easily convince somebody to buy those plans.

81
00:06:09,233 --> 00:06:11,313
 But I wouldn't recommend that to a family member.

82
00:06:11,833 --> 00:06:14,313
 So neither would I recommend to our clients as well.

83
00:06:14,473 --> 00:06:14,833
 Understood.

84
00:06:15,093 --> 00:06:16,633
