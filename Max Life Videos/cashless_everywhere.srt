1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,600
 Cashless Everywhere.

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:06,080
 One of the biggest announcements of 2024 and it came out of nowhere.

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:08,200
 It's getting everyone excited.

4
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:11,920
 So, in this video, we will explain what Cashless Everywhere means,

5
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:16,280
 how you can benefit from this and why there is one big problem

6
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:20,320
 that could mean an existential crisis for the entire scheme.

7
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,640
 So, let's get started.

8
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:24,400
 First things first, what is Cashless Everywhere?

9
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,520
 So, right now, if you have a health insurance policy

10
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:29,200
 and you have to make a claim,

11
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:30,400
 you can do it in two ways.

12
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,400
 The first is called the Cashless Procedure.

13
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,080
 This means you go to a hospital,

14
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:37,320
 you give them your policy document or your policy number

15
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:40,480
 and you tell them what problem you have and then you just chill.

16
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,800
 Because in the backend, the hospital will take care of everything.

17
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,280
 They will take your policy number,

18
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,000
 intimate the insurance company about your admission

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,560
 and they will make a claim on your behalf for the medical procedure.

20
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:54,560
 The insurance company will look at the details of your procedure

21
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:57,760
 and pre-approve a claim saying they'll pay the 2 lakhs,

22
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,080
 for instance, Manlo,

23
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:01,120
 that will cost to fix your broken shoulder,

24
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,800
 if you have a broken shoulder, that is.

25
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,520
 This way, you won't have to pay a single penny from your pocket.

26
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:08,680
 You don't even have to worry about all the medical documents

27
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:10,800
 and submit them to the insurance company

28
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,680
 because the hospital will do it for you.

29
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:15,080
 So, once again, the premise is very simple.

30
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:17,320
 You can just chill, get your procedure done

31
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:21,400
 and walk out of the hospital without worrying about documents

32
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:24,040
 or paying a single penny out of pocket.

33
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,200
 This is great.

34
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,600
 However, most claims aren't processed this way.

35
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:30,120
 They happen on a reimbursement basis,

36
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:33,080
 which means first, you pay for your medical procedure,

37
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:35,000
 broken shoulder, out of pocket,

38
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,400
 then you submit all your medical bills and documents

39
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,640
 to the insurance company

40
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,960
 and then you wait for them to pay you back,

41
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,760
 which can take a while, by the way.

42
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:45,600
 So, clearly, out of reimbursement and cashless claim,

43
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,360
 cashless claim is the way to go.

44
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:50,720
 But the only problem is that you can only make cashless claims

45
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,400
 in certain specific hospitals.

46
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:55,640
 Every insurance company ties up with some hospitals

47
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,400
 that they call network hospitals.

48
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,400
 So, if you visit a network hospital,

49
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,960
 you can make a cashless claim.

50
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,240
 If not, then reimbursement is your only option.

51
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,880
 Obviously, this has been a big problem for the industry.

52
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,760
 And that's why a few weeks ago,

53
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,480
 all the general insurance companies,

54
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:12,480
 health insurance companies came together

55
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,960
 and said that you can now make a cashless claim in any hospital

56
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:21,760
 even if it's not included in the M-Panel list of cashless hospitals

57
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,080
 for your insurer.

58
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,160
 And this is cashless everywhere.

59
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,640
 So, how will this work?

60
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,520
 Very simple.

61
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,040
 If it's a planned procedure, like say a cataract surgery or something,

62
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,040
 you have to inform the insurance company

63
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,800
 two days in advance before admission

64
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,200
 that you will be making a cashless everywhere claim.

65
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,920
 And if it's an emergency

66
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:41,840
 and you don't have time to intimidate the insurance company,

67
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,320
 then you can do it within two days of admission.

68
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,520
 Once you intimidate the insurance company,

69
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:49,200
 they will share an MOU, a Memorandum of Understanding,

70
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,200
 with the hospital regarding the rates, procedures, etc.

71
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,000
 And if your claim is legitimate,

72
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,200
 then the insurance company will pre-approve the claim.

73
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,560
 This is like cashless only,

74
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,760
 but you can do it in any hospital,

75
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,440
 whether it's a network hospital or not.

76
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,480
 Ultimately, you will have to pay no money

77
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,600
 or very little money out of pocket

78
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:09,400
 and the claim will be approved on a cashless basis.

79
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,880
 That's the promise, at least on paper.

80
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:14,680
 And this looks like a fabulous initiative.

81
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,800
 It's also a real pain point

82
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,960
 that so many customers have had for so many years.

83
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,840
 This whole business of tracking network hospitals

84
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,440
 and only visiting these hospitals for cashless claims.

85
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,440
 In fact, this is a problem that we've encountered at Ditto,

86
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,240
 making sure that we tell customers

87
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,600
 to track network hospitals

88
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,840
 and make sure they only visit those hospitals

89
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,840
 if they have to make a cashless claim.

90
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,800
 Now, with cashless everywhere,

91
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:41,320
 all these problems are solved and customers should be happy.

92
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,760
 Except there is one big issue,

93
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:47,680
 and that is the hospitals are not very happy with this scheme.

94
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,920
 In fact, the Indian Medical Association Hospital Board of India

95
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,760
 has issued an advisory

96
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:55,920
 warning all its members to not accept cashless everywhere

97
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,080
 in its current format.

98
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,200
 They're basically saying,

99
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,200
 do not accept cashless everywhere claims

100
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,800
 because this could put you out of business.

101
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,280
 You meaning the hospital.

102
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,840
 And this comes as a shock to many people

103
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,520
 who are celebrating this cashless everywhere come-o.

104
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:12,560
 And hospitals actually have their own reasons

105
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,080
 for not being very happy with this move.

106
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,880
 So let me explain this by actually explaining

107
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:21,760
 how currently cashless claims are processed in network hospitals.

108
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:25,320
 Right now, an insurance company will go to a hospital

109
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:28,320
 and tell them that they will include their facility

110
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,000
 in the cashless network in their empaneled list

111
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,800
 if they give them a package deal or discount.

112
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,160
 To give you a simple example,

113
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:38,320
 if the hospital says a total knee replacement

114
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,400
 will cost 1.5 lakhs for cash paying customers,

115
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:44,160
 then the insurer will ask for a discount package

116
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,320
 to settle the bill on a cashless basis.

117
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:49,360
 Say they'll ask for a 1 lakh quote as opposed to 1.50 lakhs.

118
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,680
 So 50,000 cut discount.

119
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,320
 And if the hospital agrees,

120
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,080
 then they will be included in the empaneled list.

121
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:58,640
 And many people who own that insurance policy

122
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,280
 may visit their facility

123
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:02,680
 because now they offer cashless benefit.

124
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:05,320
 As a result, the hospital gets better footfall,

125
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,400
 more people coming in,

126
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,840
 and the insurer can settle the bill at a discounted rate.

127
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,040
 So everybody wins.

128
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:14,080
 However, if the insurance company and the hospital

129
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,080
 cannot agree on a standard rate,

130
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,280
 then the hospital will not be included

131
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,480
 in the empaneled list of cashless hospital.

132
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:23,680
 So the hospital will lose out on the extra footfall,

133
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,600
 but that's okay because they don't want to offer the discount

134
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,400
 and they don't mind losing the footfall

135
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,480
 because from this one insurance company,

136
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,440
 how many people will come?

137
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,680
 And the thing is,

138
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,360
 different insurance companies

139
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,640
 negotiate different rates with hospitals.

140
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,120
 Private insurance companies

141
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:42,320
 usually can negotiate a 10-12% discount on the actual rate.

142
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,000
 But the public sector insurers

143
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,440
 usually get a better discount.

144
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,000
 Some 20-25%.

145
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,600
 This is because public sector insurance companies

146
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,360
 have a lot of customers.

147
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,840
 They insure a lot of people.

148
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,600
 So if you're a hospital owner

149
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,840
 and you are not on their empaneled list

150
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,160
 of cashless hospitals,

151
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,680
 then you could lose out on all these customers.

152
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,480
 Also, they can negotiate better

153
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:05,320
 because they do it together in a group called Jipsa.

154
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,720
 So they have even higher bargaining power.

155
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:10,520
 Anyway, the problem with cashless everywhere

156
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,520
 is that the current notification

157
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,200
 asks insurers to get the most economical rate

158
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,520
 while pre-approving claims.

159
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,360
 Meaning, if some hospital has entered into an agreement

160
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,240
 with public sector insurers

161
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,880
 to offer a 30% discount on the actual rate,

162
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,840
 then every insurer, whether public or private,

163
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,880
 will offer the lowest rate

164
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,640
 prior to authorizing a claim

165
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,120
 using cashless everywhere scheme.

166
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,280
 So basically, the insurance companies are saying,

167
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,040
 this is the lowest discounted rate

168
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,360
 that you will provide to us.

169
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,080
 And this is the only way cashless everywhere will work.

170
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,480
 So hospitals are naturally saying,

171
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:46,720
 sir, we cannot offer this discount to every insurer

172
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,680
 who wants to process a cashless claim

173
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,680
 because if we did, we will go broke.

174
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,640
 We can offer it to some public insurers

175
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,680
 because they bring in so many customers,

176
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,480
 but some random insurer who I've never heard of,

177
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:00,280
 you're asking me to offer such deep discounts

178
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:02,800
 to this guy too under cashless everywhere?

179
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,600
 Why? What is the point?

180
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:08,200
 In fact, in the advisory, the Hospital Board of India

181
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,880
 has even attached the actual rate

182
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,320
 according to their calculations,

183
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,960
 which hospitals should be charging,

184
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:17,400
 versus the expected rate insurers are likely to offer.

185
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,840
 And the difference in rates, as you can see,

186
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,680
 it's laughable even.

187
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,120
 There's like a 5X difference in some cases.

188
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:27,160
 So yeah, irrespective of who's right in this debate

189
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,480
 in the current format,

190
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,760
 it seems that there will be a lot of resistance

191
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:33,400
 from hospitals to accept cashless everywhere.

192
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,800
 They will most likely not accept these rates.

193
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,280
 And this leaves us with one big question.

194
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,560
 What should customers do?

195
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,520
 Our advice is very simple.

196
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,800
 In our opinion, Ditto's opinion,

197
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,920
 this will probably take a while to solve.

198
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,800
 It's not like they won't solve it, right?

199
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,880
 But before cashless everywhere

200
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:52,480
 begins to start working consistently,

201
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,960
 I think the best option is to still consider

202
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,600
 network hospitals before you buy an insurance policy.

203
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:00,360
 If an insurance company already lists a hospital

204
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,600
 in their M-Panel list of cashless hospitals,

205
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:05,360
 it means the negotiation about rates are complete.

206
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,440
 They've already agreed on the package.

207
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,760
 So there won't be any issue for customers

208
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:10,960
 on that front at least.

209
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,040
 Yes, it's possible that the insurance company

210
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,560
 may deny your cashless claim for whatever reason,

211
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,720
 but at least the hospital will not have an issue.

212
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:20,720
 So yes, cashless everywhere is an amazing scheme.

213
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,320
 However, for the time being,

214
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,440
 I think it's still important for you

215
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,480
 to probably visit a network hospital

216
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,080
 as opposed to any hospital

217
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,520
 and hope that the cashless everywhere scheme works

218
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:34,160
 because we are not entirely sure how this scheme will evolve

219
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:36,200
 in the few weeks coming ahead.

220
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,920
