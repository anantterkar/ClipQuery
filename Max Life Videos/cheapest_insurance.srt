1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,720
 Which is the best health insurance plan in India?

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:07,160
 HTFC Ergo Secure, Nivabu Par Reassure or Care Supreme?

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,940
 Well, HTFC Ergo Secure we've already covered, you can check it out here.

4
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:14,700
 So, in this video, we'll be covering everything about Care Supreme.

5
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:20,040
 The policies, features, what it covers, what's the eligibility criteria, how costly it is,

6
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:22,820
 the pros, the cons and specially the add-ons.

7
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:24,240
 Chalye shuru karte hain.

8
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:27,820
 Let's talk a little about Care Health as an insurance company.

9
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:34,320
 It started as ReliCare Health Insurance in 2012 which was later rebranded to Care in 2020.

10
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:39,080
 So compared to legacy brands like HTFC and Star, Care is relatively new.

11
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:41,560
 But still, Care hits big brands like this.

12
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:49,620
 I mean, if you look at how many policies Care sold in FY 2022-2023 compared to other players,

13
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:52,820
 you'll see that Care ranks 3rd, which is not an easy thing.

14
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:55,360
 Overall, Care is a good insurer.

15
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:59,760
 It has great numbers be it CSR, ICR, network hospitals etc.

16
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,040
 Except a few places like complaint volumes.

17
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:09,760
 Means for every 10,000 claims, the number of complaints CARE gets is actually higher than other top players.

18
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:14,420
 So we spoke with a few executives at CARE to understand why this is happening.

19
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:19,180
 And they shared some insights which you can find in our complete video review of CARE here.

20
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:22,580
 It's time to talk about the plan of the hour, CARE Supreme.

21
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:25,380
 First of all, are you even eligible for this plan?

22
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:26,740
 Most likely yes.

23
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:29,180
 The age barrier is 18 to 99.

24
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:35,220
 But if you have a pre-existing condition, it should be benign like BP, hypothyroidism,

25
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:36,220
 hernia, etc.

26
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:42,780
 The covers available are 5 lakhs, 7 lakhs, 10 lakhs, 15 lakhs, 25 lakhs, 50 lakhs and

27
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:43,500
 1 crore.

28
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:56,439
 Now if you can buy it should you buy it Product Features Like any comprehensive worthwhile health insurance plan it doesn have any copay That means you won have to pay any share of the bill from your pockets

29
00:01:56,779 --> 00:02:00,619
 You can pick any room you want, chahi presidential suite hi le lo.

30
00:02:00,859 --> 00:02:03,599
 Pre and post hospitalization expenses covered.

31
00:02:03,999 --> 00:02:05,559
 No sublimits on diseases.

32
00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:08,759
 That means koi bhi disease ho full cover hi milega.

33
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:11,739
 In fact, they cover day care procedures also.

34
00:02:11,739 --> 00:02:14,419
 like dialysis, chemo or minor surgeries

35
00:02:14,419 --> 00:02:16,539
 for which there is no need to be admitted.

36
00:02:16,819 --> 00:02:22,159
 Moreover, alternative treatments like Ayurveda, Unani, Homeopathy are also covered

37
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:26,759
 and in case you are forced to get hospitalized at home, they cover that too.

38
00:02:27,299 --> 00:02:28,619
 What about air ambulance?

39
00:02:28,999 --> 00:02:31,499
 Covered, up to 5 lakhs per year.

40
00:02:31,739 --> 00:02:33,039
 So yeah, great features.

41
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:34,439
 But that's not all.

42
00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:37,599
 They also have amazing restoration and bonus features.

43
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:43,759
 Jai se if you use up a part or whole cover amount, it gets refilled immediately.

44
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:48,119
 Your cover amount gets full again and you can use it for another hospitalization in

45
00:02:48,119 --> 00:02:51,419
 the same year, chahi same disease ho ya different.

46
00:02:51,419 --> 00:02:54,539
 They also have a 100% no claim bonus.

47
00:02:54,539 --> 00:02:59,739
 Every year you don't make a claim, a 50% bonus is added till the whole bonus is equal

48
00:02:59,739 --> 00:03:01,359
 to the sum assured.

49
00:03:01,359 --> 00:03:06,019
 Another great benefit is their 500% cumulative bonus super.

50
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:11,539
 That means whether you've made a claim or not, you get 100% of the sum assured as a

51
00:03:11,539 --> 00:03:17,379
 bonus during renewals, till the total bonus covered does not become equal to 5 times the

52
00:03:17,379 --> 00:03:18,379
 sum assured.

53
00:03:18,379 --> 00:03:22,999
 Note that this feature is a mandatory add-on for people below 45.

54
00:03:22,999 --> 00:03:26,479
 Others can pay some extra to get this benefit as an add-on.

55
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:29,999
 And if you're 76+, then the add-on is mandatory.

56
00:03:29,999 --> 00:03:35,619
 So a cover of 10 lakhs can become a cover of 70 lakhs in 5 years.

57
00:03:35,619 --> 00:03:50,199
 Also they might offer you a wellness discount of up to 30 on your premiums based on your daily number of steps to encourage fitness And the best part In sare features ke baad bhi Care Supreme is pretty cheap

58
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:53,239
 Here's a comparison between India's top health plans.

59
00:03:53,239 --> 00:03:58,359
 Clearly, Care Supreme's features for a price that low, it's an amazing deal.

60
00:03:58,359 --> 00:04:00,599
 Abhi tak humne jitte sare features samjhaye hain,

61
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:02,679
 if you want to understand them a little more,

62
00:04:02,679 --> 00:04:05,639
 you can always book a call with us at the link in description.

63
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:10,139
 Now, this begs another question. What are the caveats of this plan?

64
00:04:10,139 --> 00:04:16,899
 1. Care as an insurer receives a higher volume of complaints than most in this field, as we discussed.

65
00:04:17,159 --> 00:04:20,979
 2. Care Supreme has extremely long waiting periods.

66
00:04:21,379 --> 00:04:26,639
 For pre-existing conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular problems, etc.,

67
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:29,679
 other insurers have a waiting period of maybe 3 years.

68
00:04:29,939 --> 00:04:34,319
 That means only after 3 years of the policy purchase will they cover these diseases.

69
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:38,619
 But for Care Supreme, the waiting period is 4 years.

70
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:44,639
 That means any hospitalization that traces back to these PEDs will not be covered for 4 years.

71
00:04:45,139 --> 00:04:46,199
 And that's not great.

72
00:04:46,579 --> 00:04:54,919
 However, they give you an option to reduce the waiting periods for some specific diseases or all with the help of an add-on, which we'll address later.

73
00:04:55,299 --> 00:05:01,879
 Another caveat could be that unlike most insurers out there, Care Supreme does not offer you any free annual checkups.

74
00:05:01,879 --> 00:05:05,459
 But you can get that as an add-on so I don't count that as a biggie.

75
00:05:05,779 --> 00:05:10,159
 Now, Care Supreme is also a favourite owing to its variety of add-ons.

76
00:05:10,379 --> 00:05:15,859
 See, there are many features which might be beneficial to one person but wouldn't make a difference to another.

77
00:05:16,299 --> 00:05:17,599
 For example, maternity.

78
00:05:18,039 --> 00:05:19,439
 Maternity isn't for everyone.

79
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:23,699
 But these features, if in-built, can make the plan much costlier.

80
00:05:24,139 --> 00:05:38,198
 So Care Supreme offers you several added features as add This way you sort of customize your plan based on your specific needs Some notable add they offer include the 5x cumulative bonus super we discussed

81
00:05:38,698 --> 00:05:44,178
 one free annual health checkup as an add-on, instant coverage add-on where the company waves

82
00:05:44,178 --> 00:05:51,038
 off PED waiting periods on PEDs such as diabetes, hypertension, asthma and cholesterol. You still

83
00:05:51,038 --> 00:05:56,758
 have to serve the initial 30 day waiting period though. PED modification rider. You can reduce

84
00:05:56,758 --> 00:06:02,598
 your PED waiting period of 4 years by 1 to 3 years by paying extra. You still have to serve

85
00:06:02,598 --> 00:06:08,378
 the initial 30 day waiting period. So yeah, Care Supreme is an affordable plan with great features.

86
00:06:08,778 --> 00:06:13,958
 It's comprehensive. Plus, they offer you several add-ons which can make your plan even more

87
00:06:13,958 --> 00:06:20,118
 comprehensive. So it's a strong competition for HDFC Ergo and Niva Bupa. So what does Ditto

88
00:06:20,118 --> 00:06:23,318
 recommend. Here's what our Senior Program Manager Supreet says.

89
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:56,118
 success ratio. So one of the cons of this particular policy would be that it has a slightly

90
00:06:56,118 --> 00:07:01,478
 higher complaints ratio. However, at Ditto, we haven't faced this. We are able to tackle

91
00:07:01,478 --> 00:07:07,618
 most of the problems that have come and also the fact that we have a good rapport with

92
00:07:07,618 --> 00:07:08,418
 them helps us.

93
00:07:08,658 --> 00:07:13,358
 That was our review of Care Supreme. To know more or understand whether it's the right
