00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 You just bought health insurance thinking it'll cover your hospital bills, but during

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,400
 a claim, you're suddenly told, sir, there's a copay clause, or ma'am, your policy has

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:15,220
 a 2 lakh deductible, and now you're paying out of your own pocket, confused, angry, and

4
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:16,500
 wondering what just happened.

5
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:19,800
 And if you don't want to be in such a situation, this video is for you.

9

 copay and deductible. If you've never heard of these terms or have seen them in your policy

 but didn't understand what they meant, this one's for you. And hey, if you're not sure whether your

 advisors. We'll break it down for you. No spam, no pressure. The link is in the description.

13
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:58,560
 Now, let's begin with a situation that you might have encountered. Let's say your insurance agent

14
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:03,640
 tells you this, sir, we can reduce your premiums from 12,000 rupees to just 8,000 rupees if

15
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:06,260
 you're okay with a small 20% copay.

16
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:07,600
 Now what is copay?

17
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:20,253
 It is a clause when you agree to pay a certain percentage of the hospital bill from your own pocket every time you make a claim Just means that you splitting 20 of your bill every single time You think it just 20 right not a big deal

18
00:01:20,253 --> 00:01:25,373
 and you go ahead with the policy. Now fast forward a year your hospitalized for an unexpected surgery

19
00:01:25,373 --> 00:01:30,493
 and the bill comes to 3 lakh rupees. You pull out your policy thinking glad I got an insurance and

20
00:01:30,493 --> 00:01:36,073
 it's all covered but then comes the bill in your hand and it says you have a 20% copay which means

21
00:01:36,073 --> 00:01:41,373
 now you have to pay 60,000 rupees out of your own pocket and the insurer pays only 2,40,000.

22
00:01:41,673 --> 00:01:47,173
 Now, ask yourself, was saving 4,000 on your premiums worth paying 60,000 rupees during

23
00:01:47,173 --> 00:01:51,713
 a medical emergency? That's the problem with copay. It looks harmless when you're buying the

24
00:01:51,713 --> 00:01:56,293
 policy, but it hurts when you actually use it. Oh, and it's not a one-time cost. It applies

25
00:01:56,293 --> 00:02:01,773
 to every claim, every time. But wait, not all copays are the same. There are different types.

26
00:02:01,773 --> 00:02:07,613
 Age-based co-pay, usually found in senior citizen plans because insurers see older individuals as higher risk.

27
00:02:07,773 --> 00:02:13,553
 It ensures some cost-sharing but can lead to heavy out-of-pocket payments for the elderly who need insurance the most.

28
00:02:13,753 --> 00:02:20,493
 Treatment-specific co-pay, applied only on high-cost or planned treatments like cataract surgery, knee replacement or organ transplants.

29
00:02:20,753 --> 00:02:35,747
 Insurers do this to avoid covering expensive elective procedures immediately after policy purchase Zonal co if you buy a policy in a small city but get treated in a metro this kicks in because treatment costs are higher in big cities insurers shift some of that burden to you hospital

30
00:02:35,747 --> 00:02:40,547
 based copay applies when you go to a non-network or premium hospital not tied up with your insurer

31
00:02:40,547 --> 00:02:45,107
 since costs there are harder for insurance to control they make you share the expense so always

32
00:02:45,107 --> 00:02:50,067
 check where the copy applies because sometimes it might only apply under specific scenarios

33
00:02:50,067 --> 00:02:54,307
 now let's talk about deductibles and health insurance a deductible is a fixed amount you

34
00:02:54,307 --> 00:02:59,847
 must pay first and then your insurance kicks in. It's like a mandatory fee that you need to pay to

35
00:02:59,847 --> 00:03:04,307
 make sure your health insurance plan unlocks. Now, unlike copay, which is a person-based,

36
00:03:04,627 --> 00:03:10,167
 deductibles are flat rupee-based. For example, if your policy has a Rs 20,000 deductible and

37
00:03:10,167 --> 00:03:15,467
 your hospital bill is Rs 1,000,000, you first pay Rs 20,000 and your insurer covers the remaining

38
00:03:15,467 --> 00:03:20,967
 Rs 80,000. Now, there are two common types of deductibles. One, per-claim deductible, which is

39
00:03:20,967 --> 00:03:25,707
 applied on every claim individually. If your deductible is 2 lakh rupees and you make a claim

40
00:03:25,707 --> 00:03:31,447
 of 1.5 lakh rupees, the insurer pays nothing. Only if a single claim exceeds 2 lakh rupees will they

41
00:03:31,447 --> 00:03:36,407
 cover the extra. Second is the aggregate deductible. This one adds up all your claims in a year. Once

42
00:03:36,407 --> 00:03:50,560
 your total out expense crosses the deductible limit the insurer starts paying Way more practical if you have frequent hospital visits or base policy already Aggregate deductibles are commonly found in super top plans while per deductibles are seen in regular top plans

43
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:52,120
 Why do insurers include these?

44
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:52,860
 Two main reasons.

45
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,620
 To reduce premium costs for you and to prevent misuse of health insurance

46
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:58,840
 for non-essential or inflated treatments.

47
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:01,440
 In fact, some insurers offer these as options,

48
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,440
 letting you voluntarily choose a copay or deductible clause to lower your premium.

49
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,580
 Just be sure you understand what you're agreeing to.

50
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,920
 Should you offer a plan with copay or deductible?

51
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:14,400
 Well, if you're a senior citizen or have many PEDs, copay might be unavoidable.

52
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,560
 And that's okay.

53
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,200
 Some coverage is better than none.

54
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:20,060
 If you're younger, consider a deductible-based super top-up.

55
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,380
 It's an excellent way to get a higher sum insured and a much lower premium.

56
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:28,580
 And between the two, deductibles are better because you know your max liability and can plan for it.

57
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:34,320
 Also, pro tip, most comprehensive retail policies nowadays don't include copay or deductible clauses at all.

58
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,640
 So always check your policy wordings before you buy.

59
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:40,640
 And if you want help picking the right plan based on your health status and budget,

60
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,340
