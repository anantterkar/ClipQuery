1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,860
 Okay, imagine this. A young couple, both 30 years old, bought health insurance right after their

2
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:11,360
 wedding. They disclosed everything they could remember. But they forgot to mention that five

3
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:16,500
 years ago, one of them had a mild seasonal allergy for a few months. Fast forward four years, one of

4
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:21,280
 them needs a big surgery, a big claim. Now, normally you'd think, oh no, the insurer's going

5
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:25,840
 to dig into their old reports, find that untreated allergy history and reject the claim. But surprise,

6
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:31,280
 the insurer honor the claim fully, no arguments, no blame games. And the reason behind it? A little

7
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:36,020
 known but very powerful rule called the moratorium period. Hi folks, I'm Shank and you're watching

8
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:40,000
 Ditto Insurance. And today, I'm breaking down everything you need to know about moratorium

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,640
 period, why it matters, how it works, and how it can literally save you during your claim time.

10
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:50,020
 And if you ever feel overwhelmed by insurers fine print, or you just want to get a human being to

11
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:54,120
 explain your options without any spam, book a free call with Ditto, the links in the description.

12
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:58,840
 Alright, let's now get into it. First up, what is moratorium period in health insurance?

13
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:03,340
 The moratorium period is a special protection built into your health insurance policy. It says

14
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:08,840
 once you've completed five continuous years with a policy, your insurer cannot deny any future

15
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:13,040
 claims just because of non-disclosure or misrepresentation of medical facts at the

16
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,220
 time of buying unless it's proven that you committed a fraud. Meaning after five years,

17
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:22,700
 your insurer cannot pull out old forgotten illnesses, minor non-disclosures or missed

18
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:26,600
 surgeries to reject your claims. It's like a full forgiveness shield, protecting honest

19
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:31,740
 policyholders who may have made genuine mistakes when signing up. Now, what counts as a fraud

20
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:36,660
 though? Fraud includes acts like saying something is true when you know it's not, hiding facts you

21
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:41,940
 knew were important, any act meant to deceive the insurer or anything the law clearly defines

22
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:47,160
 as fraudulent. But here's the good news. The insurer cannot reject your claim or cancel

23
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:52,040
 your benefits on grounds of fraud if you can prove that you genuinely believe the information

24
00:01:52,040 --> 00:02:08,891
 you gave was true there was no intention to hide or mislead and the insurer already knew or should have known the facts that you didn disclose The onus or the burden of proving fraud lies with the insurer then That means it the insurance company responsibility to show with evidence

25
00:02:08,891 --> 00:02:12,871
 that the policyholder or claimant deliberately gave false information

26
00:02:12,871 --> 00:02:16,071
 or hid important facts with the intent to deceive them.

27
00:02:16,191 --> 00:02:19,831
 This is also backed by IDI guidelines and various judicial rulings in India.

28
00:02:20,371 --> 00:02:24,251
 Insurers cannot arbitrarily reject claims by simply alleging fraud.

29
00:02:24,251 --> 00:02:29,591
 fraud, they must provide clear proof that misstatement or omission was intentional and

30
00:02:29,591 --> 00:02:33,811
 it directly influenced the insurer's decision to issue the policy or pay the claim.

31
00:02:33,811 --> 00:02:38,191
 If the policyholder can demonstrate that the mistake was genuine and made in good faith

32
00:02:38,191 --> 00:02:42,351
 and there was no intent to cheat, then it does not amount to fraud and the claim cannot

33
00:02:42,351 --> 00:02:44,251
 be denied on that basis.

34
00:02:44,251 --> 00:02:47,211
 Now how long does the moratorium period last?

35
00:02:47,211 --> 00:02:51,491
 Simple answer, once you cross 5 continuous years with your insurer, the moratorium period

36
00:02:51,491 --> 00:02:54,591
 It kicks in and protects you for the entire lifetime of that policy.

37
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:59,171
 You don't have to apply for it, you don't have to pay extra for it, it happens automatically.

38
00:02:59,171 --> 00:03:03,731
 The moratorium period was initially set at 8 years under IRDI's 2020 guideline.

39
00:03:03,731 --> 00:03:07,871
 However, in a significant move to enhance consumer protection and simplify claims, the

40
00:03:07,871 --> 00:03:14,891
 IRDI reduced the moratorium period to 5 years in its revised master circular issued in April

41
00:03:14,891 --> 00:03:15,891
 2024.

42
00:03:15,891 --> 00:03:19,891
 Now, you might be thinking, isn't this the same as the waiting period?

43
00:03:19,891 --> 00:03:21,831
 Well, nope. Here's the difference.

44
00:03:22,111 --> 00:03:25,511
 Waiting periods are conditions that limit specific types of claims for a fixed time,

45
00:03:25,611 --> 00:03:29,191
 like you can't claim for cataract surgery or knee replacements for 2 years,

46
00:03:29,371 --> 00:03:31,791
 or you have to wait 3 years for pre-existing disease coverage.

47
00:03:31,931 --> 00:03:35,811
 Moratorium period, on the other hand, has nothing to do with the specific illnesses or treatment types.

48
00:03:35,911 --> 00:03:41,431
 It is purely about protecting you from claim rejections because of missed disclosures after 5 years.

49
00:03:41,431 --> 00:03:46,431
 You could still have a waiting period for knee surgery even after moratorium kicks in, if your policy says so.

50
00:03:46,431 --> 00:03:49,771
 But your insurer cannot deny a genuine hospitalization claim

51
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:52,691
 just because you forgot to mention mild asthma from 10 years ago.

52
00:03:52,691 --> 00:03:54,691
 Under the latest IDIS guidelines,

53
00:03:54,691 --> 00:04:10,902
 policyholders can now carry forward their moratorium period benefits not just when migrating to another policy within the same insurer but also when porting to a completely different insurer That means if you have completed say three years under your current policy and decide to port or migrate that credit doesn go to

54
00:04:10,902 --> 00:04:15,622
 waste. The remaining two years to complete the five-year moratorium can continue from where

55
00:04:15,622 --> 00:04:20,322
 you left off as long as the porting or migration is done seamlessly and without a break. This is

56
00:04:20,322 --> 00:04:25,502
 a big win for long-term policyholders as earlier porting or switching policies would reset the

57
00:04:25,502 --> 00:04:29,562
 moratorium period. Now, your past coverage tenure, claim for years, waiting period credits,

58
00:04:29,942 --> 00:04:34,542
 and moratorium progress all move with you. Still, at Ditto, we always say don't casually

59
00:04:34,542 --> 00:04:39,422
 port your policy for small premium savings or minor features. Sometimes staying put is the

60
00:04:39,422 --> 00:04:43,162
 smarter and safer play. And hey, if you're wondering whether you should port or stay,

61
00:04:43,502 --> 00:04:47,022
 just book a free call with us. We'll guide you properly based on your specific situation.

62
00:04:47,382 --> 00:04:50,002
 The link's in the description. Now, let's take a step back and ask,

63
00:04:50,122 --> 00:04:54,662
 why do we need moratorium period in health insurance? Because let's face it, when you

64
00:04:54,662 --> 00:04:58,642
 buy insurance, you're filling forms, answering medical questions, trying to remember every tiny

65
00:04:58,642 --> 00:05:03,122
 doctor visit you've ever had. It's super easy to miss small details without any bad intention.

66
00:05:03,282 --> 00:05:07,982
 The moratorium period acknowledges that. It builds a fairness clause into your contract. It says,

67
00:05:08,222 --> 00:05:13,362
 if you paid premiums diligently, stuck with your insurer, and being honest, after five years,

68
00:05:13,402 --> 00:05:18,162
 your insurer should stop harping on your old paperwork. It levels the playing field and it

69
00:05:18,162 --> 00:05:22,582
 builds real long-term trust. And of course, there are huge benefits of moratorium period.

70
00:05:22,582 --> 00:05:26,762
 First, peace of mind. You're not spending years worrying whether some old surgery you forgot

71
00:05:26,762 --> 00:05:31,142
 about will bite you later. Second, stronger claim certainty. Once you cross five years,

72
00:05:31,262 --> 00:05:36,102
 your insurer's ability to challenge claims reduces significantly. Third, you build stronger

73
00:05:36,102 --> 00:05:41,302
 continuity benefits. Policies with long unbroken tenures naturally become stronger because of the

74
00:05:41,302 --> 00:05:45,462
 moratorium, meaning you should ideally nurture your policy like an asset and not keep hopping

75
00:05:45,462 --> 00:05:50,362
 around every few years. But as with all things insurance, there are also common myths about

76
00:05:50,362 --> 00:05:51,362
 moratorium period.

77
00:05:51,362 --> 00:05:52,362
 Myth 1.

78
00:05:52,362 --> 00:05:54,922
 Oh, I can hide my illnesses and be safe after 5 years.

79
00:05:54,922 --> 00:05:55,922
 Absolutely wrong.

80
00:05:55,922 --> 00:06:08,152
 If you knowingly hide a major illness that clear fraud and fraud claims can be rejected even after 10 years Myth 2 Moratorium covers everything even waiting periods Wrong again Waiting periods for diseases are separate and operate differently

81
00:06:08,352 --> 00:06:11,572
 Myth 3. If I forgot to renew, I still get moratorium benefits.

82
00:06:11,792 --> 00:06:16,872
 No. If you miss your renewal grace period and your policy lapses, your moratorium is gone.

83
00:06:17,012 --> 00:06:18,652
 You have to start again from scratch.

84
00:06:18,892 --> 00:06:23,072
 Now, for anyone wondering, how do I manage the moratorium period effectively?

85
00:06:23,592 --> 00:06:25,212
 It's actually simple. Listen.

86
00:06:25,212 --> 00:06:29,892
 First, buy the right policy with full honesty and complete disclosure to the best of your knowledge.

87
00:06:30,352 --> 00:06:32,312
 Second, renew on time every time.

88
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:33,552
 Set reminders if you have to.

89
00:06:33,712 --> 00:06:35,712
 Third, if your insurer offers you upgrades,

90
00:06:36,092 --> 00:06:39,772
 opting for higher sum insured or adding super top-ups can be smart moves.

91
00:06:39,872 --> 00:06:44,332
 But keep in mind, any increase in coverage may come with its own fresh monitoring period

92
00:06:44,332 --> 00:06:46,372
 that applies to the enhanced amount.

93
00:06:46,832 --> 00:06:49,312
 And please, think carefully before porting.

94
00:06:49,632 --> 00:06:53,952
 If you really need to port, do it with the right advice, not just for the random discounts.

95
00:06:53,952 --> 00:06:56,512
 And this brings me to the next important thing.

96

 So finally, what's the conclusion?

108
00:07:22,132 --> 00:07:26,212
 The moratorium clause is one of the best consumer protection in health insurance today,

109
00:07:26,212 --> 00:07:30,932
 but it only works if you understand it and manage it carefully. It rewards you for honesty,

110
00:07:30,932 --> 00:07:34,532
 patience, and good financial discipline. Five years might seem like a long time,

111
00:07:34,532 --> 00:07:38,932
 but in the grand scheme of life, it's nothing compared to the security and peace of mind you

112
00:07:38,932 --> 00:07:42,772
 want. Protect your policy, protect your future. And if you ever need a guide on this journey,
