1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,500
 With healthcare costs skyrocketing, who'll take care of India's low-income communities?

2
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:11,880
 No need to fear, India's government health insurance schemes are here.

3
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,560
 Welcome to Ditto Insurance.

4
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:17,840
 My name is Tyra and today we'll be talking about India's top government health insurance

5
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:18,840
 schemes.

6
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:21,240
 But first, let's start with the basics.

7
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,360
 What are the benefits of health insurance?

8
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:28,300
 Firstly, it provides you with financial security against medical expenses, especially when

9
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:34,060
 it comes to cost-free critical illnesses. It also provides coverage for pre- and post-hospitalization

10
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:39,900
 costs, doctors' fees, and medications. Do note that this varies by scheme. It enables

11
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:44,460
 cashless treatments at network hospitals the availability of this might differ from policy

12
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:49,880
 to policy and you can receive tax benefits under Section 80D, but this may not apply

13
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:53,840
 to all government schemes. Now, what is a government health insurance

14
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:58,280
 scheme? It's basically a health insurance policy provided by the central or state government

15
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:02,820
 government of India. Okay, but why are they required? These schemes are mainly for the

16
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:07,320
 rural population and people who live below the poverty line, because they are the ones who don't

17
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:12,400
 have access to high-quality medical facilities. As a result, they resort to cheaper options that

18
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:18,040
 barely provide coverage or remedial measures. Also, even if they want to opt for comprehensive

19
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:22,700
 healthcare, it would consume a huge amount of their income and savings. But with government

20
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:27,460
 health insurance, both at central and state level, they'll receive the right funding to meet their

21
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:32,240
 healthcare requirements. Alright, before we delve into the nitty-gritties, let me tell you a little

22
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:37,140
 about us here at Ditto. We're an insurance advisory platform built by FinShots, India's

23
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:42,320
 favorite new age newsletter. We provide honest and spam-free advice about health and term insurance.

28
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:06,640
 about the role and apply in the link in description. Now, let's compare regular health insurance plans

29
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:11,620
 with government health insurance schemes. In terms of eligibility criteria, for health insurance

30
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:16,740
 plans, anyone is eligible for the same, regardless of their employment and financial status. Whereas,

31
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:21,220
 for government health insurance plans, most schemes are only available to the low-income

32
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:26,240
 community. After all, it was mainly made for them. In terms of some insured, health insurance plans

33
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:30,440
 can have coverages up to 1 crore and above, but for government health insurance schemes,

34
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:35,780
 coverage goes up to max 5 lakhs. Looking at purchase availability, health insurance plans

35
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:41,020
 provide immediate policy purchases both online and offline. You also have the freedom to visit

36
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:45,120
 the website and buy it yourself. Whereas for government health insurance schemes, there's a

37
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,720
 longer purchase time because of the multiple steps and numerous documents to be submitted to avail

38
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:54,800
 the scheme. With health insurance plans, domiciliary coverage is more or less available to the policy

39
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:59,580
 holder, depending on the plan they have availed. However, there is no domiciliary coverage available

40
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:04,600
 under government health insurance schemes. In terms of renewing the policy, for health insurance plans,

41
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:09,520
 it's a very quick and easy online process. But for government health insurance schemes, doing it

42
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:14,860
 online may or may not be an option. Moving on to network hospitals, health insurance plans usually

43
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:19,180
 have providers working with the best private hospitals for treatment. Government health

44
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:24,280
 insurance schemes include both public and private hospitals in their network. Under health insurance

45
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:30,980
 plans, no claim bonus is available and may extend from 10% to 200% or may go even higher depending

46
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:36,720
 on your policy. Tax benefits are available under section 80D, as I mentioned earlier, and free

47
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:41,140
 annual health checkups are available as well, but may vary based on the policy you purchase.

48
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:55,311
 These three features however are not available under government health insurance schemes And And finally our last feature to compare claim settlement Claim settlement under health insurance plans usually take less time than under government health insurance schemes Now coming to what

49
00:03:55,311 --> 00:03:59,951
 we have all been waiting for, the top government health insurance schemes. Starting with the

50
00:03:59,951 --> 00:04:05,191
 central government schemes. First, we have the Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana.

51
00:04:05,571 --> 00:04:10,691
 This policy's purpose is to match the medical expenditure requirement of the bottom 40% of

52
00:04:10,691 --> 00:04:15,851
 the population. The eligibility criteria for this policy are the income of the family and

53
00:04:15,851 --> 00:04:21,331
 individuals. The coverage this policy offers is max rupees 5 lakh. This scheme covers three days

54
00:04:21,331 --> 00:04:26,231
 of hospitalization charges and 15 days of post-hospitalization expense. This plan also

55
00:04:26,231 --> 00:04:31,631
 covers all pre-existing diseases with no waiting period for the same. Policyholders also get to

56
00:04:31,631 --> 00:04:36,551
 enjoy the perks of cashless treatment at network hospitals and additional coverage for ICU charges,

57
00:04:36,551 --> 00:04:42,651
 doctors' fees, prescription medicines, and more. The annual premium for this policy is just Rs. 30.

58
00:04:42,951 --> 00:04:46,971
 Next, we're looking at the Employee State Insurance Scheme. This scheme is designed

59
00:04:46,971 --> 00:04:52,811
 for factory workers earning a max of Rs. 21,000 as a monthly wage, Rs. 25,000 for workers with

60
00:04:52,811 --> 00:04:57,751
 disabilities. This scheme's purpose is to help these workers meet medical expenses in case of

61
00:04:57,751 --> 00:05:02,691
 accidents or occupational hazards. This plan requires an equal part payment towards the

62
00:05:02,691 --> 00:05:07,331
 premium to be made by the employer and the employee, except in the case of workers earning

63
00:05:07,331 --> 00:05:12,371
 less than Rs 137 per day, in which the employer pays the entire premium. The plan is extended to

64
00:05:12,371 --> 00:05:17,691
 the employee and his or her family and offers a sickness benefit of up to 91 days per year and an

65
00:05:17,691 --> 00:05:22,471
 extended sickness benefit of up to 2 years in the case of malignant or long-term ailments.

66
00:05:22,791 --> 00:05:27,751
 This scheme also offers a disability benefit, a 26-week maternity benefit and a dependence

67
00:05:27,751 --> 00:05:32,411
 benefit due to the workplace hazard. We then have the Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bhima Yojana.

68
00:05:32,411 --> 00:05:36,511
 This scheme is an initiative to boost insurance penetration in India.

69
00:05:36,731 --> 00:05:42,131
 The scheme aims to offer funds to its policyholders in the case of accidental disability and or death.

70
00:05:42,251 --> 00:05:48,111
 The plan also offers a coverage of Rs 2 lakhs in the case of complete accidental disability or death

71
00:05:48,111 --> 00:05:50,631
 and 1 lakh in the case of partial disability.

72
00:05:50,731 --> 00:05:54,451
 All that the policyholder needs to avail of this scheme is their Aadhaar card

73
00:05:54,451 --> 00:05:58,431
 and a bank account from which the premium for this will be automatically deducted.

74
00:05:58,431 --> 00:06:00,891
 Coming to the Rashtriya Swastika Bhima Yojana,

75
00:06:00,891 --> 00:06:06,031
 This government scheme protects individuals working in unorganized sectors across India.

76
00:06:06,191 --> 00:06:11,691
 This scheme offers Rs 30,000 for workers and their families to cover the expenses for hospitalization,

77
00:06:12,131 --> 00:06:16,131
 treatment of diseases and transportation, which is capped at Rs 1,000.

78
00:06:16,191 --> 00:06:20,551
 By paying a premium of Rs 30 per year, the plan offers cashless benefits too.

79
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:22,711
 As for the Janani Suraksha Yojana,

80
00:06:23,071 --> 00:06:27,711
 this is a maternity health insurance policy that aims to ensure healthy pregnancy treatments

81
00:06:27,711 --> 00:06:30,271
 are available for both mothers and newborns.

82
00:06:30,271 --> 00:06:35,371
 The targeted market in this case is expecting women who are economically disabled or dependent

83
00:06:35,371 --> 00:06:38,131
 and need the funding to undergo a healthy delivery.

84
00:06:38,331 --> 00:06:42,671
 This scheme covers the delivery process as well as post-delivery care assistance.

85
00:06:42,871 --> 00:06:48,551
 Policy holders get completely free treatment in government hospitals along with some cash assistance.

86
00:06:48,551 --> 00:06:56,091
 For low-performing states, Rs 2,000 or Rs 700 and for high-performing states, Rs 1,200 or Rs 600.

87
00:06:56,531 --> 00:06:59,991
 This is based on whether they are located in rural areas or urban ones.

88
00:06:59,991 --> 00:07:04,211
 Our last central government scheme to be discussed is the Universal Health Insurance Scheme.

89
00:07:04,331 --> 00:07:08,131
 This scheme is like the government's version of a family floater health insurance plan.

90
00:07:08,351 --> 00:07:13,611
 It offers medical coverage for the entire family, especially those who are economically disabled.

91
00:07:14,091 --> 00:07:18,451
 This policy covers medical expenses for the entire family up to Rs 30,000.

92
00:07:18,611 --> 00:07:26,071
 It also covers expenses related to the doctor's consultation fees, hospitalisation, maternity, room rent and medical supply.

93
00:07:26,071 --> 00:07:39,242
 This policy also offers a cover of up to Rs 25 in case of accidental death Let move on to the state government schemes Starting with Maharashtra Mahatma Jyotibha Phool Jan Arogya Yojana which is a scheme designed by

94
00:07:39,242 --> 00:07:43,722
 the Maharashtrian government for those living below the poverty line. The cashless benefit of

95
00:07:43,722 --> 00:07:48,722
 this scheme can be availed by the underprivileged. This includes families. So that includes those

96
00:07:48,722 --> 00:07:55,082
 with an Anapurna ration card, Antyodiya Ana Yojana ration card, a yellow, orange or red ration card

97
00:07:55,082 --> 00:08:00,082
 holder, residents of government, Mahila ashrams and senior citizen homes and children living in

98
00:08:00,082 --> 00:08:05,002
 government orphanages. This plan extends its coverage to the entire family of the policyholder

99
00:08:05,002 --> 00:08:10,742
 and this scheme offers a sum insured of Rs 2.5 lakhs in case of renal transplants and Rs 1.5

100
00:08:10,742 --> 00:08:15,222
 lakhs for hospitalization expense. Next, we have Rajasthan's Bhamasha Swastia Bhima Yojana.

101
00:08:15,862 --> 00:08:20,602
 This scheme is for Rajasthan's rural population as well as the beneficiaries under the National

102
00:08:20,602 --> 00:08:25,802
 Food Security Act and the Rashtriya Swastia Bhima Yojana. This scheme is a comprehensive

103
00:08:25,802 --> 00:08:31,002
 health insurance plan with a host of features and perks for policyholders, such as pre- and

104
00:08:31,002 --> 00:08:36,822

105
00:08:36,822 --> 00:08:41,842
 critical ailments, coverage of Rs 30,000 for general illnesses, cashless treatment options,

106
00:08:42,002 --> 00:08:47,162
 and OPD treatment coverage. Then we have Tamil Nadu's Chief Minister's Comprehensive Insurance

107
00:08:47,162 --> 00:08:52,002
 scheme. This scheme is launched by the Tamil Nadu government in association with United India

108
00:08:52,002 --> 00:08:56,842
 Insurance Company Limited. This scheme is a family floater health insurance policy offered

109
00:08:56,842 --> 00:09:02,522
 to individuals with an annual income of less than Rs 75,000. Under this scheme, individuals can

110
00:09:02,522 --> 00:09:08,002
 claim up to Rs 5 lakhs for hospitalization expenses and can opt to get treated in either private or

111
00:09:08,002 --> 00:09:12,242
 public healthcare facilities. This government health insurance scheme also offers to cover

112
00:09:12,242 --> 00:09:18,382
 1,000 plus medical procedures. The West Bengal Health Scheme, launched in 2008, offers financial

113
00:09:18,382 --> 00:09:23,422
 assistance to government employees and pensioners for any and all medical treatments. This scheme

114
00:09:23,422 --> 00:09:28,502
 can be an individual and family floater policy, depending on the requirements of the policyholder.

115
00:09:28,642 --> 00:09:34,042
 The sum insured offered under this policy is capped at Rs 1 lakh, which also covers OPD

116
00:09:34,042 --> 00:09:38,542
 treatments and medical surgeries. Coming to Karnataka's Yashaswini Health Insurance Scheme,

117
00:09:38,542 --> 00:09:43,002
 This scheme's purpose is to boost health and wellness across the state of Karnataka,

118
00:09:43,262 --> 00:09:45,422
 specifically for poor people and farmers.

119
00:09:45,702 --> 00:09:50,842
 This scheme will grant them access to quality healthcare services without it eating into their life savings.

120
00:09:50,982 --> 00:09:55,022

121
00:09:55,022 --> 00:10:00,642
 and offers coverage for 823 surgical procedures from close to 600 network hospitals.

122
00:10:00,882 --> 00:10:03,602
 Next, we have Mukhya Mantri Amrutam Yojana.

123
00:10:03,962 --> 00:10:08,082
 This is a family floater health insurance plan offered by Gujarat's state government

124
00:10:08,082 --> 00:10:13,002
 where the policyholder gets access to medical treatments across trusted public and private

125
00:10:13,002 --> 00:10:18,422
 hospitals without any financial strain. This scheme has a sum insured of up to Rs 3 lakhs,

126
00:10:18,622 --> 00:10:21,762
 catering to the medical requirements of the poor and low-income community.

127
00:10:21,882 --> 00:10:26,682
 We now have Kerala's Karonia Health Scheme, which is a critical illness health insurance cover for

128
00:10:26,682 --> 00:10:31,702
 those who have an annual income of less than Rs 3 lakhs. This scheme was designed to aid those

129
00:10:31,702 --> 00:10:36,402
 suffering from critical diseases like the ones listed on the slide. The Kerala government extends

130
00:10:36,402 --> 00:10:41,422
 adequate coverage of Rs 5 lakhs to fund these medical treatments. This coverage caters to

131
00:10:41,422 --> 00:10:46,622
 secondary and tertiary hospitalisation care. Policyholders can claim hospitalisation charges,

132
00:10:46,962 --> 00:10:52,522
 surgical charges, ICU room rents, medicine charges, crucial diagnostic tests and doctor's fees. All

133
00:10:52,522 --> 00:10:57,002
 they need with them is their medical history, Aadhaar card and income certificate to benefit

134
00:10:57,002 --> 00:11:02,602
 from this scheme. Now, coming to Andhra's Dr. YSR Aarogya Sri Healthcare Trust, which includes

135
00:11:02,602 --> 00:11:04,602
 four different health insurance schemes.

136
00:11:04,602 --> 00:11:07,982
 The Arogya Rakshya Scheme for those above the poverty line,

137
00:11:07,982 --> 00:11:11,942
 the Dr. YSR Arogya Sri Scheme for those below the poverty line,

138
00:11:11,942 --> 00:11:14,862
 the Employee Health Scheme for state government employees,

139
00:11:14,862 --> 00:11:31,074
 the Working Journalist Health Scheme which covers selected medical procedures This scheme is available both as individual health and as family floater plans This scheme offers coverage of Rs 5 lakhs per annum for the family This cover can be utilised for hospitalisation expenses cashless treatments

140
00:11:31,074 --> 00:11:36,274
 for 30 days after discharge for those undergoing therapy, treatment of pre-existing diseases,

141
00:11:36,574 --> 00:11:41,554
 post-hospitalisation treatment coverage for 20 days, follow-up treatments and check-ups.

142
00:11:41,554 --> 00:11:47,174
 It also offers outpatient care for its policyholders at government hospitals and health camps.

143
00:11:47,354 --> 00:11:51,514
 And finally, we have Telangana's State Government Employees and Journalists Health Scheme.

144
00:11:51,754 --> 00:11:56,474
 This scheme offers premium healthcare services to government employees and the state journalists.

145
00:11:57,034 --> 00:12:03,854
 This plan offers substantial coverage to meet the medical requirements for retired and current employees and pensioners of the state government.

146
00:12:03,994 --> 00:12:07,834
 This prevents them from using their savings for emergency medical requirements.

147
00:12:07,834 --> 00:12:14,034
 There is no upper limit for some insured and no contributions need to be made by either the pensioners or the employees.

148
00:12:14,534 --> 00:12:21,214
 Alright, now that we have explained each and every central and state government health insurance scheme, let me tell you about some of their caveats.

149
00:12:21,314 --> 00:12:28,754
 Firstly, in terms of coverage, government health insurance schemes provide very little coverage that often falls short of the medical treatment charges.

150
00:12:29,254 --> 00:12:36,414
 Additionally, unlike the best health insurance policies, these schemes come with disease-wise sublimits and caps on procedures and features.

151
00:12:36,414 --> 00:12:42,234
 This means you might be looking at a substantial expenditure from your personal savings to deal with medical costs.

152
00:12:42,374 --> 00:12:47,834
 Also, some government health insurance policies do not offer funding for certain ailments and procedures.

153
00:12:48,154 --> 00:12:52,714
 Government insurance schemes are only available in certain regions, states, or nations.

154
00:12:52,934 --> 00:12:54,334
 Provider network limitations.

155
00:12:54,734 --> 00:12:58,894
 Government schemes have a limited network of doctors, hospitals, and healthcare providers.

156
00:12:59,314 --> 00:13:02,854
 This makes it difficult for policyholders to enjoy cashless benefits.

157
00:13:03,134 --> 00:13:04,414
 Eligibility limitations.

158
00:13:04,414 --> 00:13:09,954
 Government health insurance schemes demand certain criteria to be met by an individual for enrollment.

159
00:13:10,434 --> 00:13:13,894
 This includes citizenship, employment, age, etc.

160
00:13:14,314 --> 00:13:15,054
 Waiting periods

161
00:13:15,054 --> 00:13:22,214
 A majority of public health insurance plans have a waiting period before certain perks and coverages can be accessed by the policyholder.

162
00:13:22,474 --> 00:13:24,194
 And finally, claim settlements

163
00:13:24,194 --> 00:13:30,754
 Generally, the claim settlement time for government health insurance schemes is much higher than regular health insurance plans.

164
00:13:30,754 --> 00:13:36,054
 Okay, so why should you consider regular health insurance alongside government schemes?

165
00:13:36,294 --> 00:13:37,554
 For enhanced coverage

166
00:13:37,554 --> 00:13:42,054
 Regular health insurance plans offer higher sum insured, wider coverage for procedures

167
00:13:42,054 --> 00:13:46,894
 and other benefits like OPD, maternity, ponies, restoration, etc.

168
00:13:47,074 --> 00:13:47,994
 For wider network

169
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:52,374
 Regular health insurance plans provide access to a broader network of hospitals

170
00:13:52,374 --> 00:13:54,914
 both public and private for cashless treatment

171
00:13:54,914 --> 00:13:55,954
 For flexibility

172
00:13:55,954 --> 00:14:00,514
 With regular health insurance plans, there is more flexibility in plan selection

173
00:14:00,514 --> 00:14:02,834
 based on your specific needs and budget.

174
00:14:02,954 --> 00:14:06,494
 For renewal convenience, easier online renewals for continued coverage

175
00:14:06,494 --> 00:14:09,594
 is an added benefit with regular health insurance policies.

176
00:14:09,914 --> 00:14:13,034
 For the waiting period, most regular health insurance plans

177
00:14:13,034 --> 00:14:16,094
 have paid add-ons available to reduce the waiting period.

178
00:14:16,174 --> 00:14:18,474
 For claim settlement, as seen earlier,

179
00:14:18,634 --> 00:14:21,994
 one of the greatest benefits of having a regular health insurance plan

180
00:14:21,994 --> 00:14:25,914
 is that the claims are settled in less time than government health insurance claims.

181
00:14:26,234 --> 00:14:27,794
 So, what does Ditto think?

182
00:14:27,794 --> 00:14:32,194
 Government health insurance schemes definitely play a vital role in making healthcare more

183
00:14:32,194 --> 00:14:37,174
 accessible for low-income families. However, their limitations are that they may not provide

184
00:14:37,174 --> 00:14:42,874
 complete protection. And so, exploring regular health insurance plans alongside these schemes

185
00:14:42,874 --> 00:14:47,154
 can offer a more comprehensive safety net against rising medical costs.

186
00:14:47,474 --> 00:14:52,854
