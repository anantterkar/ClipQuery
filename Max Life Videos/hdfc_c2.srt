3
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:14,900
 In this video, we'll be doing an in-depth analysis of HDFC Life's two newest term plans in the market.

4
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:17,740
 Click to Protect Elite Plus and Click to Protect Ultimate.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,520
 Now, you might be wondering, how do these compare to HDFC Life's bestseller, Click to Protect Super?

6
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,760
 Are they worth considering or is it just another marketing hype?

7
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,660
 Well, we're going to break it down all for you.

8

 The link is in the description. Go check it out.

17
00:00:56,860 --> 00:01:01,620
 Alright, let's now dive in and take a look at both of these plans that we have lined up for today.

18
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:07,660
 First up is HDFC Click to Protect Elite Plus, which is a revamped version of Click to Protect Elite.

19
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:14,060
 So, HDFC Life's C2P Elite Plus is essentially an upgraded version of their previous C2P Elite plan.

20
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:17,760
 The older version didn't gain much traction, mostly because of its restrictions.

21
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:24,360
 But now, with some key improvements, Elite Plus is trying to strike a balance between affordability and useful benefits.

22
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:28,360
 Now, if you're wondering whether this plan is meant for you, here's a simple checklist.

23
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,080
 Are you looking for a cheaper HDFC term insurance option but still want a solid base plan?

24
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:36,600
 Are you okay with skipping the terminal in its cover and life stage benefits,

25
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,060
 which by the way is available in C2P Super,

26
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:42,720
 in exchange for perks like premium break and immediate payout on claim intimation?

27
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:46,860
 Are you earning at least 10 lakh LPA aged between 18 to 45

28
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:49,540
 and looking for coverage between 2 and 5 crores?

29
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:54,560
 If you answered yes to most of these questions, then this plan might be worth looking at.

30
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,740
 Now let's talk about who can apply and some possible limitations.

31
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:00,180
 You need to be between 18 to 45 years.

32
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:05,280
 Unlike most plans that let you enter till 60-65 years, this one is a bit stricter.

33
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:10,460
 You can buy coverage for up to 40 years, but the maximum age at maturity is 85 years.

34
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,780
 So no option for whole life coverage here.

35
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:16,160
 This plan is open to both salaried and self-employed individuals,

36
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,780
 but you need to be making at least 10 lakh LPA annually.

37
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:23,760
 The minimum coverage starts at 2 crores and goes all the way up to 5 crore rupees.

38
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:28,300
 Here you have the flexibility with regular pay, 5 pay, 10 pay and 15 pay.

39
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:31,380
 Alright, let's look at some key inbuilt features that set this plan apart.

40
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,380
 First up is the premium break benefit.

41
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:37,260
 This is an interesting one because after completing 5 policy years,

42
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:42,260
 you can choose to take a 12-month break from paying premiums while still being covered.

43
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:46,560
 You can do this multiple times, but there needs to be a 5-year gap between each break.

44
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,520
 The catch? You can't use this benefit in the last 5 years of your policy.

45
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:54,340
 But do note that you've only deferred the payment of these premiums.

46
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:58,260
 They will still have to be paid in the next year along with that year's premiums.

47
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:15,926
 The benefit is that there is no worry of policy lapsation or late fees Next benefit is the immediate payout on claim intimation Now this is a great feature If the policyholder passes away 5 lakh rupees will be paid to the nominee within one working day subject to relevant document submission However the remaining sum assured will follow

48
00:03:15,926 --> 00:03:19,606
 the usual claim settlement process. Third benefit is the smart exit benefit,

49
00:03:19,966 --> 00:03:24,386
 also known as zero cost option. Want to walk away from the policy after 25 years? Well,

50
00:03:24,606 --> 00:03:29,406
 you can surrender it and get back all the premiums you've paid, but there's one condition.

51
00:03:29,406 --> 00:03:32,726
 You need to have taken the policy for at least 31 years

52
00:03:32,726 --> 00:03:35,866
 and it doesn't apply if you've opted for return of premium option.

53
00:03:36,006 --> 00:03:40,326
 Let's talk about riders because having the right riders can make a world of difference.

54
00:03:40,546 --> 00:03:42,106
 First up is a critical illness rider.

55
00:03:42,286 --> 00:03:46,426
 It covers 60 critical illnesses for a maximum duration of 15 years.

56
00:03:46,666 --> 00:03:47,946
 Second is the waiver of premium.

57
00:03:48,146 --> 00:03:49,166
 This is a must-have.

58
00:03:49,286 --> 00:03:51,526
 If you're diagnosed with critical illness or disability,

59
00:03:51,806 --> 00:03:53,946
 you won't have to pay any further premiums.

60
00:03:54,066 --> 00:03:56,526
 But your coverage, it still gets continued.

61
00:03:56,786 --> 00:03:58,966
 Third, it's the accidental income benefit.

62
00:03:58,966 --> 00:04:06,306
 If an accident leads to total or permanent disability, you'll receive 1% of the rider's summer short per month for 10 years.

63
00:04:06,666 --> 00:04:12,946
 So, if you choose a 1 crore rider, you get 1 lakh rupees for a month for the next 120 months.

64
00:04:13,306 --> 00:04:15,086
 Now, that's a solid income replacement.

65
00:04:15,406 --> 00:04:17,846
 Well, folks, no plan is golden and perfect.

66
00:04:18,086 --> 00:04:19,606
 So, what's missing in this?

67
00:04:19,866 --> 00:04:21,446
 There is no terminal-less rider.

68
00:04:21,846 --> 00:04:25,306
 This means if this is something you need, you're better off with C2P Super.

69
00:04:25,306 --> 00:04:27,946
 Also, there is no live stage benefit option.

70
00:04:27,946 --> 00:04:32,666
 meaning you can't increase your coverage when major life events like marriage or childbirth happen.

71
00:04:32,666 --> 00:04:38,346
 Also, there are no housewife cover, no joint life cover or increasing decreasing cover options.

72
00:04:38,346 --> 00:04:42,826
 But on the brighter side, HDFC has always rolled out some solid discounts.

73
00:04:42,826 --> 00:04:46,426
 A 7% discount if you're salaried, a high summer short discount,

74
00:04:46,426 --> 00:04:51,146
 that is 7% off for regular pay and 10% off for limited pay.

75
00:04:51,146 --> 00:04:53,626
 But both these apply only to first year premiums.

76
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:55,226
 What is Ritter's recommendation?

77
00:04:55,226 --> 00:05:01,466
 If you're between 18-45 years old, earning 10 LPA plus and looking for 2-5 crore cover,

78
00:05:01,466 --> 00:05:05,786
 this plan is definitely worth considering. The pricing is lower than C2P Super,

79
00:05:05,786 --> 00:05:10,506
 even without the discounts and the premium break and smart exit benefits make it attractive.

80
00:05:10,506 --> 00:05:14,906
 However, we're still waiting for clarity on the availability of Waiver of Premium Rider

81
00:05:14,906 --> 00:05:18,266
 before giving it a full thumbs up. Before we head to discuss the next plan,

82
00:05:18,266 --> 00:05:23,146
 folks let me remind you that researching and understanding a term insurance policy document

83
00:05:23,146 --> 00:05:28,906
 or even a brochure can take anywhere between 20 to 30 hours. Let Ditto help you save that time and

84
00:05:28,906 --> 00:05:33,066
 effort and guide you through the whole process. All you have to do is book a free consultation

85
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:37,786
 with our advisors with the link mentioned in the description and in just 30 minutes our

86
00:05:37,786 --> 00:05:43,546
 IDI certified advisors will help you choose the best policy. Let's move on to HDFC Click to Protect

87
00:05:43,546 --> 00:05:50,106
 Ultimate which is the next plan. At first glance it seems to offer a big promise 100% claim

88
00:05:50,106 --> 00:05:56,106
 guarantee. Well, sounds great right? But here's the catch. IRDI already mandates that claims

89
00:05:56,106 --> 00:06:01,106
 must be settled post 3 years of holding a policy. So this guarantee isn't as groundbreaking

90
00:06:01,106 --> 00:06:04,566
 as it sounds. Let's break it down for you. First, let's see if you are eligible for this

91
00:06:04,566 --> 00:06:19,932
 plan Entry age 18 years Policy term maximum 40 years with coverage until 85 years Education qualification only graduates and above are eligible Income requirement minimum 10 lakh LPA annual salary but unlike Elite Plus this plan is only available to salaried individuals

92
00:06:20,292 --> 00:06:24,152
 It has a geographical restriction that is only residents of tier 1 cities.

93
00:06:24,312 --> 00:06:28,992
 Ahmedabad, Chennai, Bengaluru, Delhi, Mumbai, Pune, etc. can get this plan.

94
00:06:29,152 --> 00:06:31,832
 Summer short ranges from 1 crore to 3 crores.

95
00:06:32,032 --> 00:06:35,552
 Now, let's take a look at the in-built features of C2P Ultimate.

96
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:37,152
 First, the smart exit benefit.

97
00:06:37,152 --> 00:06:40,612
 This is just like in the Elite Plus, but limited to long-term policies.

98
00:06:40,772 --> 00:06:42,972
 That is, the minimum tenure is 31 years.

99
00:06:43,232 --> 00:06:47,412
 Second is terminal illness benefit with up to 2 crore coverage with a 6-month waiting period.

100
00:06:47,572 --> 00:06:48,632
 Third, claim guarantee.

101
00:06:48,852 --> 00:06:50,492
 This is important, so hear me out.

102
00:06:50,652 --> 00:06:52,852
 What does 100% claim guarantee mean?

103
00:06:52,992 --> 00:06:58,612
 HGFC Life claims that with this plan, all valid claims will be honoured without any rejections.

104
00:06:58,792 --> 00:07:01,572
 This is meant to provide policyholders with assurance that

105
00:07:01,572 --> 00:07:04,672
 their loved ones will receive the payout without any hassle.

106
00:07:04,812 --> 00:07:05,632
 But here's the thing.

107
00:07:05,632 --> 00:07:12,432
 The Insurance Act of 1938 under Section 45 already ensures that once a policy has completed 3 years,

108
00:07:12,772 --> 00:07:17,972
 the insurer cannot reject a claim due to misrepresentation or non-disclosure,

109
00:07:18,132 --> 00:07:22,772
 except in case of clear fraud, where the burden of proving the fraud lies on the insurer.

110
00:07:22,932 --> 00:07:29,012
 So, the claim guarantee doesn't really provide any extra protection beyond what IRDI regulations already mandate.

111
00:07:29,192 --> 00:07:34,212
 But despite the 100% claim guarantee, there are still situations where a claim can be denied.

112
00:07:34,392 --> 00:07:35,052
 Let's go through them.

113
00:07:35,052 --> 00:07:39,532
 Suicide is not covered in the first year. This is a standard exclusion across most term plans.

114
00:07:39,852 --> 00:07:44,532
 Death due to substance abuse. If the policyholder dies due to alcohol or drug overdose,

115
00:07:44,912 --> 00:07:49,032
 the claim will be rejected. If the nominee is involved in the death of the policyholder,

116
00:07:49,172 --> 00:07:53,692
 if there is any criminal involvement from the nominee, the insurer will not pay out the

117
00:07:53,692 --> 00:07:58,012
 summer shot to that nominee. If the policyholder was engaged in criminal activity at the time of

118
00:07:58,012 --> 00:08:02,892
 death. So this means that death occurring during participation in any illegal activities like

119
00:08:02,892 --> 00:08:06,672
 robbery, violence or terrorism etc. will not be covered.

120
00:08:06,792 --> 00:08:10,532
 This policy also comes with some strict conditions that could affect claim approval.

121
00:08:10,672 --> 00:08:15,032
 First up is non-disclosure of serious illnesses like cancer or autoimmune diseases.

122
00:08:15,312 --> 00:08:19,532
 So, if a policyholder does not disclose these conditions at the time of purchase,

123
00:08:19,812 --> 00:08:21,292
 the claim will not be paid.

124
00:08:21,392 --> 00:08:23,212
 Unlike other plans where premium loadings,

125
00:08:23,432 --> 00:08:25,932
 that are higher premiums for health risks, are applied,

126
00:08:26,132 --> 00:08:29,372
 C2P ultimately follows an accept or reject approach.

127
00:08:29,372 --> 00:08:32,212
 The policyholder will need to undergo comprehensive tests,

128
00:08:32,212 --> 00:08:37,712
 including treadmill tests, USG whole abdomen scan, chest x-ray and additional diagnostic tests

129
00:08:37,712 --> 00:08:43,152
 if required. If any serious health conditions are detected, the application will not be accepted at

130
00:08:43,152 --> 00:08:47,772
 all rather than offering coverage with a higher premium. Is this claim guarantee really a game

131
00:08:47,772 --> 00:08:52,572
 changer? Well, not really. Here's a summary why. Most term insurance plans already settle valid

132
00:08:52,572 --> 00:08:57,432
 claims within a reasonable time, so this feature doesn't add much extra security. Plus, the

133
00:08:57,432 --> 00:09:01,652
 Extensive medical tests make it harder for many applicants to even get approved,

134
00:09:01,652 --> 00:09:04,732
 meaning fewer people can actually benefit from this guarantee.

135
00:09:04,732 --> 00:09:07,112
 Finally, what's missing in C2P Ultimate?

136
00:09:07,112 --> 00:09:10,732
 1. There is no critical illness benefit. This is a crucial omission.

137
00:09:10,732 --> 00:09:14,232
 2. No waiver of premium. If you become disabled or critically ill,

138
00:09:14,232 --> 00:09:24,438
 you will still have to keep paying if you want to be covered 3 No accidental disability riders This is a serious gap for comprehensive coverage Finally what does Ditto take on Click to Protect Ultimate

139
00:09:24,618 --> 00:09:26,558
 Honestly, we do not recommend this plan.

140
00:09:26,778 --> 00:09:27,238
 And the reason?

141
00:09:27,438 --> 00:09:28,838
 The claim guarantee sounds fancy,

142
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:33,438
 but that does not add much value beyond what's already required by RDI regulations.

143
00:09:33,678 --> 00:09:36,738
 Plus, premiums are 10-15% higher than C2P Super,

144
00:09:36,978 --> 00:09:39,238
 making it expensive without real benefits.

145
00:09:39,238 --> 00:09:43,438
 If you want better coverage, Elite Plus or Super is a much better bet.

146
00:09:43,438 --> 00:09:46,078
 Finally, before we end the video, let's take a look at the premiums.

147
00:09:46,078 --> 00:09:51,278
 Scenario 1. For a 25 year old male, 2 crore coverage, non-smoker and choosing regular pay.

148
00:09:51,278 --> 00:09:57,198
 If you take a policy till the age of 60, Elite Plus will cost you 15,825 rupees in the first year,

149
00:09:57,198 --> 00:10:00,558
 increasing to 18,400 rupees from the second year onwards.

150
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:05,678
 The same plan under Ultimate will cost a whopping 23,300 rupees in the first year,

151
00:10:05,678 --> 00:10:12,558
 rising to 24,500 from the second year. That's a 7,500 extra per year for Ultimate compared to

152
00:10:12,558 --> 00:10:17,138
 to Elite Plus. And if you decide to extend the policy till 65 or 70, the trend remains the same.

153
00:10:17,298 --> 00:10:23,538
 Elite Plus is significantly cheaper with Ultimate costing about 6,500 to 7,500 more per year.

154
00:10:23,898 --> 00:10:29,378
 Scenario 2. For a 30-year-old female, 2 crore cover, non-smoker, regular pay. A 30-year-old

155
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:35,998
 opting for the coverage till 60 would pay 16,800 rupees in the first year and 19,400 from the

156
00:10:35,998 --> 00:10:41,418
 second year under Elite Plus. In contrast, Ultimate costs 23,000 rupees in the first year,

157
00:10:41,418 --> 00:10:44,458
 increasing to 25,000 rupees from the second year.

158
00:10:44,598 --> 00:10:47,958
 Now, that's a 6,000 to 7,000 rupees solid difference per year.

159
00:10:48,098 --> 00:10:50,838
 For longer policy terms, up until 65 or 70 years,

160
00:10:51,038 --> 00:10:52,078
 the difference widens,

161
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:54,738
 with Elite Plus remaining cheaper by at least, again,

162
00:10:54,918 --> 00:10:57,678
 6,500 rupees to 7,500 rupees annually.

163
00:10:57,938 --> 00:11:02,058
 Alright folks, so we've broken down HDFC Live's new term insurance plans.

164
00:11:02,058 --> 00:11:06,538
 Click to protect Elite Plus and click to protect Ultimate in detail.

165
00:11:06,938 --> 00:11:09,698
 We've compared their features, benefits, exclusions,

166
00:11:09,698 --> 00:11:11,938
 and most importantly, the premiums.

167
00:11:12,078 --> 00:11:12,978
 What does Deto recommend?

168
00:11:13,098 --> 00:11:15,098
 Click to Protect Elite Plus is a solid plan.

169
00:11:15,238 --> 00:11:17,578
 It offers good value, lower premiums,

170
00:11:17,778 --> 00:11:20,218
 and smart features like premium break and smart exit,

171
00:11:20,378 --> 00:11:23,258
 making it a strong contender if you're looking for an affordable

172
00:11:23,258 --> 00:11:26,418
 yet effective term insurance option from HDFC Life.

173
00:11:26,618 --> 00:11:28,478
 Click to Protect Ultimate, on the other hand,

174
00:11:28,618 --> 00:11:32,158
 comes with a higher price tag, but does not justify the extra cost.

175
00:11:32,318 --> 00:11:35,538
 The so-called 100% claim guarantee is more of a marketing play

176
00:11:35,538 --> 00:11:36,978
 rather than a real game changer.

177
00:11:36,978 --> 00:11:41,058
 Plus, it lacks important riders, has stricter eligibility criteria,

178
00:11:41,298 --> 00:11:46,378
 and is only available in limited locations, making it an impractical choice for most people.

179
00:11:46,498 --> 00:11:51,418
 If you're looking for the best term insurance plan from HDFC Life, Elite Plus is worth considering.

180
00:11:51,598 --> 00:11:56,098
 But if you want the most flexibility, most coverage, and better features,

181
00:11:56,618 --> 00:11:59,518
 Click2Protect Super still remains our top recommendation.

182
00:11:59,878 --> 00:12:01,758
