1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:02,980
 During COVID-19, hospitals were full.

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:06,860
 People with serious illnesses had no choice but to get treated at home.

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:08,300
 But here's the big question.

4
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,140
 Can your health insurance cover treatments done at home?

5
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:12,220
 The answer is yes.

6
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:14,800
 But only if you know about domiciliary hospitalization.

7
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:23,220
 Hi everyone, I'm Shashank and you're watching Ditto Insurance.

8
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:25,200
 And in this episode of Health Insurance 101,

9
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,420
 we'll explain when and how you can claim insurance for treatments done at home

10
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:31,920
 and why it's not as simple as it sounds.

11
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:34,360
 And hey, if you want someone to check your policy

12
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:36,120
 and tell you if this benefit is included,

13
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:37,660
 you can book a free call with Ditto.

14
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:39,060
 Link is in the description.

15
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:41,040
 What is domiciliary hospitalization?

16
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,440
 It refers to a medical treatment for an illness

17
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,840
 that would normally require hospitalization

18
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,420
 but is instead done at home due to many reasons.

19
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:51,720
 The patient being too unwell to move

20
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:53,800
 or no hospital beds being available.

21
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:56,980
 Think of it as hospital-level care at home

22
00:00:56,980 --> 00:00:58,300
 under medical supervision.

23
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:01,960
 See, it's not the same as basic home care or hiring a nurse.

24
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:04,480
 It has to meet some strict conditions.

25
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,180
 Let's understand this with an example.

26
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:11,080
 Mr. Sharma, who's aged 75, develops pneumonia during a COVID-19 wave.

27
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:12,480
 No ICU beds are available.

28
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:16,400
 A doctor recommends oxygen, IV fluids and continuous monitoring.

29
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:17,980
 All this done at home.

30
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:20,840
 Since this treatment would normally require hospitalization

31
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:25,720
 and it's supported by doctor's notes and bills, it qualifies for domiciliary claim.

32
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,300
 Now, when is it covered?

33
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:45,073
 The treatment is for a condition that would usually need admission It lasts more than 3 days A doctor certifies hospitalization is needed All treatment is under a doctor supervision detailed records and bills are available But here the catch most insurers only reimburse these expenses no cashless option

34
00:01:45,273 --> 00:01:51,913
 Many common illnesses are excluded like asthma, diabetes, bronchitis, cold and flu, psychiatric issues etc.

35
00:01:52,153 --> 00:01:57,613
 So always check your policy to know is domiciliary care covered, what diseases are excluded,

36
00:01:57,613 --> 00:02:00,033
 Are pre and post hospitalization expenses included?

37
00:02:00,273 --> 00:02:02,033
 Is there a sublimit or duration rule?

38
00:02:02,393 --> 00:02:05,153
 Now, domiciliary versus home health care.

39
00:02:05,393 --> 00:02:06,353
 Don't confuse the two.

40
00:02:06,593 --> 00:02:12,073
 Domiciliary, it's done at home because you can't be moved or there's no hospital bed available.

41
00:02:12,313 --> 00:02:13,673
 And this is usually reimbursed.

42
00:02:14,033 --> 00:02:19,813
 Home health care, it's done at home too, but by choice, but pre-approved by insurer.

43
00:02:20,033 --> 00:02:24,733
 This is often cashless through network providers and not all insurers offer this.

44
00:02:24,873 --> 00:02:26,773
 A couple of final tips before we close the video.

45
00:02:26,773 --> 00:02:29,593
 Keep doctor's prescription and treatment summary ready.

46
00:02:29,773 --> 00:02:32,773
 Maintain daily treatment records signed by a doctor.

47
00:02:33,053 --> 00:02:35,433
 Submit all bills and documents on time.

48
00:02:35,693 --> 00:02:37,093
 And what is the bottom line?

49
00:02:37,213 --> 00:02:39,933
 Dormitory cover is a lifesaver in emergencies,

50
00:02:40,353 --> 00:02:43,233
 especially for elderly patients or during hospital shortages.

51
00:02:43,453 --> 00:02:47,753
 But it only works if your policy supports it and your paperwork is perfect.

52
00:02:47,833 --> 00:02:50,833
 So if you want help checking whether your policy offers this benefit,

53
00:02:50,993 --> 00:02:51,953
 book a free call with Ditto.

54
00:02:52,093 --> 00:02:53,133
 No jargon, no pressure.

55
00:02:53,133 --> 00:02:56,393
 And in the next episode, we'll cover cumulative bonuses.

56
00:02:56,773 --> 00:03:01,173
 how your sum and chart grows every year and what happens when you make a claim.

57
00:03:01,173 --> 00:03:05,333
 So folks, if this video helped you, share it with someone caring for elderly parents.

58
00:03:05,333 --> 00:03:06,453
 Happy insurance hunting!
