[0.96 - 2.98]  During COVID-19, hospitals were full.
[3.16 - 6.86]  People with serious illnesses had no choice but to get treated at home.
[7.04 - 8.30]  But here's the big question.
[8.48 - 11.14]  Can your health insurance cover treatments done at home?
[11.34 - 12.22]  The answer is yes.
[12.50 - 14.80]  But only if you know about domiciliary hospitalization.
[20.42 - 23.22]  Hi everyone, I'm Shashank and you're watching Ditto Insurance.
[23.46 - 25.20]  And in this episode of Health Insurance 101,
[25.68 - 29.42]  we'll explain when and how you can claim insurance for treatments done at home
[29.42 - 31.92]  and why it's not as simple as it sounds.
[32.34 - 34.36]  And hey, if you want someone to check your policy
[34.36 - 36.12]  and tell you if this benefit is included,
[36.48 - 37.66]  you can book a free call with Ditto.
[37.88 - 39.06]  Link is in the description.
[39.32 - 41.04]  What is domiciliary hospitalization?
[41.28 - 43.44]  It refers to a medical treatment for an illness
[43.44 - 45.84]  that would normally require hospitalization
[45.84 - 49.42]  but is instead done at home due to many reasons.
[49.86 - 51.72]  The patient being too unwell to move
[51.72 - 53.80]  or no hospital beds being available.
[54.04 - 56.98]  Think of it as hospital-level care at home
[56.98 - 58.30]  under medical supervision.
[58.30 - 61.96]  See, it's not the same as basic home care or hiring a nurse.
[62.14 - 64.48]  It has to meet some strict conditions.
[64.72 - 66.18]  Let's understand this with an example.
[66.42 - 71.08]  Mr. Sharma, who's aged 75, develops pneumonia during a COVID-19 wave.
[71.32 - 72.48]  No ICU beds are available.
[72.98 - 76.40]  A doctor recommends oxygen, IV fluids and continuous monitoring.
[76.58 - 77.98]  All this done at home.
[78.16 - 80.84]  Since this treatment would normally require hospitalization
[80.84 - 85.72]  and it's supported by doctor's notes and bills, it qualifies for domiciliary claim.
[85.96 - 87.30]  Now, when is it covered?
[87.30 - 105.07]  The treatment is for a condition that would usually need admission It lasts more than 3 days A doctor certifies hospitalization is needed All treatment is under a doctor supervision detailed records and bills are available But here the catch most insurers only reimburse these expenses no cashless option
[105.27 - 111.91]  Many common illnesses are excluded like asthma, diabetes, bronchitis, cold and flu, psychiatric issues etc.
[112.15 - 117.61]  So always check your policy to know is domiciliary care covered, what diseases are excluded,
[117.61 - 120.03]  Are pre and post hospitalization expenses included?
[120.27 - 122.03]  Is there a sublimit or duration rule?
[122.39 - 125.15]  Now, domiciliary versus home health care.
[125.39 - 126.35]  Don't confuse the two.
[126.59 - 132.07]  Domiciliary, it's done at home because you can't be moved or there's no hospital bed available.
[132.31 - 133.67]  And this is usually reimbursed.
[134.03 - 139.81]  Home health care, it's done at home too, but by choice, but pre-approved by insurer.
[140.03 - 144.73]  This is often cashless through network providers and not all insurers offer this.
[144.87 - 146.77]  A couple of final tips before we close the video.
[146.77 - 149.59]  Keep doctor's prescription and treatment summary ready.
[149.77 - 152.77]  Maintain daily treatment records signed by a doctor.
[153.05 - 155.43]  Submit all bills and documents on time.
[155.69 - 157.09]  And what is the bottom line?
[157.21 - 159.93]  Dormitory cover is a lifesaver in emergencies,
[160.35 - 163.23]  especially for elderly patients or during hospital shortages.
[163.45 - 167.75]  But it only works if your policy supports it and your paperwork is perfect.
[167.83 - 170.83]  So if you want help checking whether your policy offers this benefit,
[170.99 - 171.95]  book a free call with Ditto.
[172.09 - 173.13]  No jargon, no pressure.
[173.13 - 176.39]  And in the next episode, we'll cover cumulative bonuses.
[176.77 - 181.17]  how your sum and chart grows every year and what happens when you make a claim.
[181.17 - 185.33]  So folks, if this video helped you, share it with someone caring for elderly parents.
[185.33 - 186.45]  Happy insurance hunting!
