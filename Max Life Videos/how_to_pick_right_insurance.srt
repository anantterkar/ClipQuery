00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,500
 Hello folks, welcome to Ditto Insurance. I am Shashank, your host, and today we are going to

2
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:14,740
 dive deep into one of the topics that is very crucial if you are out on a hunt for a health

3
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:21,340
 insurance. Folks, you're aware about the rising medical costs every year. Inflation is at 14-15%.

4
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:27,620
 So having health insurance at this moment is not an option anymore. It's a dire necessity. So

5
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:38,380
 So when you head out to buy that first health insurance of yours, your insurers or your advisors might keep telling you that, hey, these are the metrics that you need to follow.

6
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:39,940
 These are the features that you need to see.

7
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:50,820
 But one thing that they might miss out is telling you that the financial stability of the insurer is one of the biggest factors in deciding if you should go with that company or not.

8
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:57,700
 So to exactly decode this and take you through this world of incurred claim ratio or ICR,

9
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:02,460
 I have with me Rishabh Kashyap, who is the Senior Partnership Manager here at Ditto.

10
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:03,500
 Welcome, Rishabh.

11
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:05,120
 Thanks, Rishabh. Glad to be here once again.

12
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:11,580
 So Rishabh, today let's speak about ICR because it's one of the least spoken topics in the insurance industry.

13
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:19,580
 and I feel that it is important for people to know that a company with a certain range of ICR

14
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:26,040
 is better for them in a way. Now, take us through ICR in your experience.

15
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:30,580
 It's pretty straightforward. Let's think of it this way. What's your favorite restaurant in

16
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:35,680
 Bangalore? Where do you prefer the most to go? I think it would be Yuki, JP Nagar.

17
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,760
 Okay, why not Kormangala because there are two branches?

18
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:44,120
 Well, I think it's mainly because of the reviews of Yuki, JP Nagar that got me there.

19
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:54,480
 Right. So that just happens to be one of the factors, one of the metrics that you would consider that Yuki, JP Nagar is better than one of the other branches that they have in Kormangala.

20
00:01:54,480 --> 00:02:09,040
 So similarly, it's the case with health insurance as well, where ICR is an indicative metric to showcase the financial strength or like a financial report card, so to say, for an insurance company.

21
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:13,220
 So basically, insurance companies collect premiums.

22
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:28,232
 Now how much premiums that they have collected versus how much claims that they paid out So that factor that ratio is what is called as an incurred claim ratio Understood So basically how much premiums they collect versus how much claims have dispersed

23
00:02:28,452 --> 00:02:29,392
 So that's the ratio?

24
00:02:29,612 --> 00:02:30,572
 That's the ratio, yes.

25
00:02:30,812 --> 00:02:35,772
 So if an insurer has collected, let's say, about 100 crores worth of premium

26
00:02:35,772 --> 00:02:39,332
 and they have paid out 80 crores as claims.

27
00:02:39,632 --> 00:02:43,112
 Now that's an ICR or incurred claim ratio of 80%.

28
00:02:43,112 --> 00:02:44,372
 Understood. Pretty straightforward.

29
00:02:44,372 --> 00:02:52,792
 Now, we say that CSR has to be at least 90% or above. Is that the same for ICR?

30
00:02:52,792 --> 00:03:14,212
 Indeed. So it's not one particular number or a higher value per se, but rather a definitive range. So a healthy range to consider for an insurance company's ICR would be anywhere between 50 to 80%. So as long as the company's ICR tends to be between 50 to 80, that's a good metric to look at.

31
00:03:14,212 --> 00:03:24,612
 So anything less than that is a little concern because, let's say, insurers would be concerned more from the profit perspective rather than paying out the claims.

32
00:03:25,292 --> 00:03:31,192
 And anything more than that, more than 80%, it would be too generous.

33
00:03:31,912 --> 00:03:39,052
 So do you think that ICR can help the customers in recognizing the red flags in an insurer?

34
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:52,912
 Certainly. So to bring in a specific example of individual insurers, so let's take HTFC Ergo General Insurance and Aditya Birla General Insurance.

35
00:03:53,412 --> 00:03:59,432
 Now, HTFC Ergo has a healthy range of around 80% as an ICR.

36
00:03:59,692 --> 00:04:04,492
 Similarly with Aditya Birla, it stands to be somewhere around 65 to maybe 70%.

37
00:04:04,492 --> 00:04:15,392
 But then you have standalone health insurance companies like Care Health Insurance or Niva Bupa, where their ICR stands to be between, I believe, 55 to 58%.

38
00:04:15,392 --> 00:04:33,132
 Now, general insurance company can actually have a higher ICR or slightly more than standalone health insurance companies because any claims that they pay of a higher value for health insurance can be used as an offset by utilizing other insurance products that they sell.

39
00:04:33,392 --> 00:04:36,792
 But you can't say the same about standalone health insurance companies

40
00:04:36,792 --> 00:04:56,025
 because most of their products are towards the healthcare side So they will end up paying more in terms of the claims So which is why it tends to be lesser as compared to the ICR tends to be lesser as compared to general insurance companies Undisturbed And Rishabh I would you know at this point want

41
00:04:56,025 --> 00:05:00,505
 to ask you a question. But before I come to that question, let me tell the viewers a little

 So go ahead and book your free consultation with us with a link in the description.

54
00:05:39,965 --> 00:05:41,285
 Now, Rishabh, back to the question.

55
00:05:42,065 --> 00:05:48,285
 What if an insurer has ICR, which is more, say more than 80-90%?

56
00:05:48,805 --> 00:05:50,905
 That means they're being really generous, right?

57
00:05:51,205 --> 00:05:52,725
 I mean, who wouldn't love that?

58
00:05:53,205 --> 00:06:01,265
 Well, of course, the policyholders would benefit because every single claims that they bring in.

59
00:06:01,825 --> 00:06:04,225
 So the insurer will eventually end up paying it.

60
00:06:04,225 --> 00:06:08,605
 So one example is recently we did a video on Ifco Tokyo.

61
00:06:09,305 --> 00:06:12,785
 So Ifco Tokyo's ICR shows 116%.

62
00:06:12,785 --> 00:06:16,685
 Now, this might be overly generous, but this is not a good sign.

63
00:06:17,145 --> 00:06:24,785
 So this basically shows that the insurance company is paying out more claims than the insurance premiums that they are collecting.

64
00:06:24,785 --> 00:06:35,125
 So this means that the insurance company would constantly need recapitalization of funds in order to run their shop, keep the lights on.

65
00:06:35,505 --> 00:06:38,225
 So take examples of PSU health insurance companies.

66
00:06:38,565 --> 00:06:45,645
 So you have your Oriental Insurance, you have your New India Company, and also you have United Health Insurance.

67
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:51,085
 All these PSU companies tend to have more than 100% plus as incurred claim ratio.

68
00:06:51,865 --> 00:06:54,065
 But it's a common trend as well,

69
00:06:54,165 --> 00:06:55,485
 if anybody can actually observe,

70
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:57,385
 that PSU health insurance company

71
00:06:57,385 --> 00:06:59,465
 need constant recapitalization of funds

72
00:06:59,465 --> 00:07:00,905
 in order to stay afloat,

73
00:07:01,385 --> 00:07:16,377
 which is also because of many welfare public welfare or social welfare related schemes which they pay out a lot of claim amounts for So this is why a higher incurred claim ratio is never a good thing

74
00:07:17,297 --> 00:07:19,637
 Now, Rishabh, one thing I've noticed is that

75
00:07:19,637 --> 00:07:23,057
 on Instagram, on your Google,

76
00:07:23,197 --> 00:07:26,037
 you keep getting ads of these insurance companies.

77
00:07:26,497 --> 00:07:30,977
 And one thing that they market well is that our CSR is the best.

78
00:07:30,977 --> 00:07:33,737
 our CSR is amazing.

79
00:07:33,957 --> 00:07:36,237
 It's over 90%, over 95%.

80
00:07:36,237 --> 00:07:38,937
 They say that we have so many network hospitals.

81
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:43,037
 But why doesn't anyone talk about ICR?

82
00:07:43,137 --> 00:07:46,797
 Because after knowing so much about ICR in depth,

83
00:07:47,017 --> 00:07:51,157
 how important it is that your insurer doesn't run out of funds.

84
00:07:51,477 --> 00:07:52,957
 Why is ICR less talked?

85
00:07:53,437 --> 00:07:56,357
 So, CSR, ICR,

86
00:07:56,357 --> 00:07:59,817
 these are all the pieces of the puzzle that you can use

87
00:07:59,817 --> 00:08:05,417
 in order to make a conclusive decision as to which health insurance companies that you can reliably

88
00:08:06,217 --> 00:08:10,617
