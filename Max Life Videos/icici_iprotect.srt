00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,680
 Welcome to Ditto Insurance. My name is Kavya and today we'll be covering ICICI iProtect

2
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:16,060
 Smart Term Plan, the features, costs, problems and who should buy it. So stay tuned and let's

3
00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:21,400
 begin. So who should consider this plan? See, if you want a reliable brand name with stable

4
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:27,640
 performance, then obviously ICICI is a great option. This plan has a good number of add-ons

5
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:33,380
 to make your plan more comprehensive. And they offer a zero cost option where you get your

6
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:39,360
 premiums back if you give up the policy during a specific term. And it's a good plan at economical

7
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:45,500
 premiums. Before we move to the features, how is ICICI doing compared to other players? Their

8
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:51,340
 three-year claim settlement ratio is 97% which is less than other top players but still up to the

9
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:55,580
 Their 3 year amount settlement ratio is 92%.

10
00:00:55,580 --> 00:01:01,640
 Now this means for every Rs 100 claim they pay out only Rs 92 which is also a good number.

11
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,920
 Now coming to the volume of complaints.

12
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:09,060
 As you can see their numbers is much higher than other players so it may be a cause of

13
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:10,060
 concern for you.

14
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:12,460

21
00:01:44,508 --> 00:01:50,288
 WhatsApp, so talk to us at the link in description. ICICI Protect has multiple variants based

22
00:01:50,288 --> 00:01:57,028
 on the add-ons you pick. Their entry age is 18-25, available terms are from 5 years to

23
00:01:57,028 --> 00:02:03,568
 85 years and their cover starts from 50 lakhs. Moreover, there are some more criteria that's

24
00:02:03,568 --> 00:02:09,028
 on your screen. Coming to the basic features. Here is a list of their top features and paid

25
00:02:09,028 --> 00:02:15,588
 add-ons, let's get into them one by one. Waiver of premiums is an inbuilt feature which allows you to

26
00:02:15,588 --> 00:02:21,988
 stop paying premiums in case of total disabilities. Critical illness benefit offers a lump sum payout

27
00:02:21,988 --> 00:02:27,868
 to you which is deducted from your cover. Now it covers 34 illnesses that's on your stream.

28
00:02:27,868 --> 00:02:33,688
 Another feature is zero cost benefit. So if your policy is a minimum of 25 years,

29
00:02:33,688 --> 00:02:49,596
 If you have more than 5 years left and you in your 60s you can surrender your plan and get back your premiums Life stage benefit offers you to increase your cover in case you start a family or for some any other reason but your premiums will increase too

30
00:02:49,956 --> 00:02:56,216
 Next we have the accidental death benefit add-on where you get an additional sum over your cover

31
00:02:56,216 --> 00:03:02,036
 in case of accidental demise. This is a good rider if you are a frequent traveler and you can get

32
00:03:02,036 --> 00:03:07,256
 some discounts too. Lastly we have terminal illness rider. Here in case you're diagnosed

33
00:03:07,256 --> 00:03:13,636
 with a terminal illness, ICICI gives you the whole cover for you to utilize. Now before we jump to

34
00:03:13,636 --> 00:03:19,916
 the costs, let's look at the payment terms. One is of course the regular premium. Next is limited pay

35
00:03:19,916 --> 00:03:27,896
 where you pay all your premiums in 5, 7, 10 or 15 parts or you pay only till you're 60 or you can

36
00:03:27,896 --> 00:03:33,376
 just pay for the whole thing one time. You can make your payments monthly, yearly, quarterly or

37
00:03:33,376 --> 00:03:39,056
 half yearly. Moving on to the costs. Now, the premiums depend on gender and whether you're

38
00:03:39,056 --> 00:03:44,836
 a smoker. We have compared the premiums with HTFC Click to Protect Super and Max Life Elite.

39
00:03:45,156 --> 00:03:50,376
 The premiums are on your screen. As you can see, the premiums are pretty economical compared to

40
00:03:50,376 --> 00:03:55,776
 the other two plans. So, what are the problems? First, the critical illness rider could be a

41
00:03:55,776 --> 00:04:10,904
 problem because the amount is deducted from the cover and other plans in the market might not cut it from the cover at the same price Some insurers also cover critical illness as well as accidental disability under the waiver of premiums which is more beneficial

42
00:04:11,444 --> 00:04:17,084
 And lastly, ICICI prudential is not serviceable in a few PIN codes due to restrictions.

43
00:04:17,464 --> 00:04:19,784
 So now that is done, what does Ditto think?

44
00:04:20,144 --> 00:04:24,784
 See, this is one of the best in the market owing to the brand's value and performance.

45
00:04:24,964 --> 00:04:26,864
 But are there any alternatives?

46
00:04:27,284 --> 00:04:28,744
 Depends on what you want.

47
00:04:28,744 --> 00:04:34,824
 If you are looking for a simple base plan, then ICICI EyeProtect Smart is a good option.

48
00:04:35,364 --> 00:04:44,924
 But if you are looking for add-ons like Critical Illness Without Deductions or a better waiver of premiums option that covers both Critical Illness and Accidental Permanent Disability,

49
00:04:45,304 --> 00:04:52,844
 you have good alternatives like HDFC Click to Protect Super, MaxLife Smart Secure Elite or Tata AI Sampoorna Raksha.

50
00:04:53,004 --> 00:04:54,124
 So, what do we recommend?

51
00:04:54,124 --> 00:04:58,704
 If you are looking for comprehensive riders, this might not be the best plan for you.

52
00:04:58,744 --> 00:05:03,824
 But if you're looking for a pure term plan, this is an economical plan from a good company.

53
00:05:04,144 --> 00:05:06,644
 Plus, the premiums are good for smoker profiles.

54
00:05:07,004 --> 00:05:13,684
