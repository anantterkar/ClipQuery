00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,200
 For the past few weeks, ICICI Lombard General Insurance has constantly been the talk of the town.

2
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:12,780
 Now, although Lombard is not a partner at Ditto, we'd like to do an honest analysis of how good is

3
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:18,540
 it as an insurance company. First of all, ICICI Lombard is a general insurance company, which

4
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:24,320
 means they have many types of insurance like travel insurance, health insurance, etc. This

5
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:29,280
 means that they would have a limited number of plans compared to a standalone health insurance

6
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:35,840
 company like Care. Now, ICICI Lombard was established in 2001. It is a joint venture

7
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:42,740
 between ICICI Bank with 64% stake and Fairfax Financial Holdings Limited, a Toronto-based

8
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:49,000
 financial services company. So basically, ICICI Lombard has been in the market for two decades

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,900
 now. So how is it doing? Now before we go ahead, a little about Ditto. We're an insurance advisory

10
00:00:54,900 --> 00:01:00,020
 platform built by FinShots, India's favourite New Age newsletter. To date, we've advised

11
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:05,780
 over 3 lakh people and we provide honest or spam-free advice about health and term insurance.

12
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:23,014
 First of all we will never push you to buy You can take as much time as you want And if you do choose to buy from us we will guide you through the entire journey as well as the claim settlement process This way you can sit back take your time to weigh your options and buy when you want to buy

13
00:01:23,014 --> 00:01:27,014
 We are available on calls as well as WhatsApp. Talk to us at the link in description.

14
00:01:27,014 --> 00:01:30,014
 Coming to ICICI Lombard's operational metrics.

15
00:01:30,014 --> 00:01:36,014
 Looking at the last three years, we can see that their claim settlement ratio has ranged around 85%

16
00:01:36,014 --> 00:01:42,254
 while the industry average has been around 90. Basically, they're only settling 85 claims per

17
00:01:42,254 --> 00:01:49,814
 100 and that's pretty low. I mean, at Ditto, we recommend a CSR of above 90. So, ICICI is

18
00:01:49,814 --> 00:01:55,814
 falling short. Now, let's see the incurred claim ratio. This has stayed around 85% over the years,

19
00:01:55,914 --> 00:02:00,294
 which is more or less around the industry average. So, works well. This means they're

20
00:02:00,294 --> 00:02:05,674
 paying the claims as well as making money. They have a network of 7,500 plus cashless hospitals

21
00:02:05,674 --> 00:02:10,794
 and centers. Now this is again less given the industry average is around 9100.

22
00:02:10,794 --> 00:02:17,714
 Lastly, we've got complaint volumes and this is where ICICI is neck to neck with HDFC.

23
00:02:17,714 --> 00:02:22,514
 In the last three years, they've received seven to eight complaints for every 10,000

24
00:02:22,514 --> 00:02:33,987
 claims which is insanely low This proves that their service and operations team is pretty efficient But also given it a general insurance company their health insurance number could be averaged

25
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:39,507
 out over the other products. So all in all, it's a decent insurance company. So why haven't we

26
00:02:39,507 --> 00:02:45,827
 partnered with ICICI Lombard? Before I answer that, let me tell you about ICICI Lombard's top

27
00:02:45,827 --> 00:02:51,907
 plans. Health Advantage, which is one of the most comprehensive plans in the market. It offers great

28
00:02:51,907 --> 00:02:58,627
 features like only 2 year waiting period for PEDs, restoration, alternative treatments covered,

29
00:02:59,007 --> 00:03:05,427
 and no unnecessary room rent or disease-wise limits. Moreover, it covers animal bite vaccinations,

30
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:12,127
 bariatric treatments, and international treatments too. However, it offers a very low loyalty bonus.

31
00:03:12,287 --> 00:03:17,887
 Another good plan is Health Elite Plus, which has similar features as Advantage. However,

32
00:03:17,887 --> 00:03:23,347
 However, it has room rent limits, sublimits on catracks and very low loyalty bonus.

33
00:03:23,347 --> 00:03:25,047
 Then we have iHealth+.

34
00:03:25,047 --> 00:03:30,307
 It also has a 2-year PD waiting period, no room rent restriction, alternative treatments

35
00:03:30,307 --> 00:03:31,307
 covered.

36
00:03:31,307 --> 00:03:34,107
 Plus, it offers OPD and maternity cover.

37
00:03:34,107 --> 00:03:49,801
 But it also has disease sublimits very very low loyalty bonus and restrictions on restoration Lastly we have Health which is slightly cheaper than iHealth The features are also similar So why haven we partnered with ICICI Lombard

38
00:03:49,941 --> 00:03:53,841
 See, ICICI Lombard is a decent pick as a provider.

39
00:03:54,341 --> 00:03:58,561
 But when we give recommendations, we are transparent about the insurers' metrics.

40
00:03:59,001 --> 00:04:01,701
 And the first thing people look at is CSR.

41
00:04:01,941 --> 00:04:03,821
 Everyone knows what CSR is.

42
00:04:03,821 --> 00:04:09,121
 So, given that their CSR is kinda low, it can be a turn off for some people.

43
00:04:09,121 --> 00:04:12,661
 Network hospitals, another word everyone has probably heard.

44
00:04:12,661 --> 00:04:13,661
 That's also low here.

45
00:04:13,661 --> 00:04:19,321
 However, we should not forget that ICICI is exceptional with its complaint volumes.

46
00:04:19,321 --> 00:04:21,941
 In fact, their plans also have great features.

47
00:04:21,941 --> 00:04:28,061
 So, if you're someone who trusts ICICI as a brand, then you can easily consider it.

48
00:04:28,061 --> 00:04:33,261
 However, if an insurance company's operational metrics are important to you and their low

49
00:04:33,261 --> 00:04:36,941
 No numbers bother you, you can check out other insurers in the market.

50
00:04:36,941 --> 00:04:42,821
