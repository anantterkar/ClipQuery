00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,720
 Welcome to Ditto Insurance. My name is Kavya and today we'll be reviewing ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Company.

2
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:18,300
 The company's metrics, their top plans, the features, costs and all. So stay tuned and let's begin with the background history.

3
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:25,320
 It was established in 2000 as a joint venture between ICICI Bank and Prudential Corporation Holdings.

4
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:28,720
 So basically, they've been around for more than 2 decades.

5
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:33,020
 It's one of the top 3 private players with max life and HDFC life.

6
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:34,380
 So, how is it doing?

7
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:37,200
 Now, before we go ahead, a little about Ditto.

8
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:43,020
 We are an insurance advisory platform built by FinShots, India's favorite new age newsletter.

9
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:50,840
 To date, we've advised over 3 lakh people and we provide honest or spam-free advice about health and term insurance.

10
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:53,020
 First of all, we will never push you to buy.

11
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:55,080
 You can take as much time as you want.

12
00:00:55,320 --> 00:01:02,560
 And if you do choose to buy from us, we will guide you through the entire journey as well as the claim settlement process.

13
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:08,240
 This way, you can sit back, take your time to weigh your options and buy when you want to buy.

14
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:12,060
 We are available on calls, so talk to us at the link in description.

15
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:15,760
 Also, we are hiring for insurance advisory team members.

16
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:20,840
 It's a work from home role with no sales targets and no prior experience needed.

17
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:22,720
 Apply at the link in description.

18
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:28,960
 Coming to ICICI Prudential's operational metrics. Look at the last three years, they've been

19
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:43,742
 settling 97 of the claims it receives which may be slightly less for term insurance but still pretty reliable Now let see the amount settlement ratio which stands at 92 This means for every Rs 100

20
00:01:43,742 --> 00:01:50,422
 claimed, they give out Rs. 92. But this doesn't mean that all claims are partially given. It's

21
00:01:50,422 --> 00:01:56,582
 just a ratio of the total amount of money given versus total amount claimed in a year. Lastly,

22
00:01:56,582 --> 00:02:02,822
 we've got the complaint volumes. In the last 3 years, they've received 14 complaints for every

23
00:02:02,822 --> 00:02:09,782
 10,000 claims, which is more than its competitors. But the industry average is 72. So, pretty less

24
00:02:09,782 --> 00:02:14,882
 still and stats a good thing. So, all in all, it's a decent insurance company. Let me tell you

25
00:02:14,882 --> 00:02:20,662
 ICI Prudential's plan options. They offer many types of life insurance plans such as simple

26
00:02:20,662 --> 00:02:27,222
 term plans, ULIPs, insurance for children, etc. At Ditto, we believe in keeping insurance and

27
00:02:27,222 --> 00:02:32,582
 investment separate. So, we will look at the term insurance plans offered by ICICI.

28
00:02:32,782 --> 00:02:39,702
 They have two variants, ICICI iProtect Smart and iProtect Return of Premiums. We will look at both

29
00:02:39,702 --> 00:02:45,302
 the variants in short but we have done a detailed review of iProtect Smart on our channel. The link

30
00:02:45,302 --> 00:02:50,642
 is in the description. Now, iProtect Smart is one of the best term plans in the market because

31
00:02:50,642 --> 00:02:56,722
 it's comprehensive, affordable and it has the best riders to choose from. The list of both inbuilt

32
00:02:56,722 --> 00:03:02,962
 riders and add-ons is on your screen. Now look at the most popular riders in the market. You can see

33
00:03:02,962 --> 00:03:19,065
 that iPretect has them except for the option to change your cover or get monetary benefits in case of total permanent disability So what are the drawbacks Though ICICI offers many add and flexible zero options major add like Waiver

34
00:03:19,065 --> 00:03:22,425
 of Premiums and Critical Illness have a few limitations.

35
00:03:22,425 --> 00:03:29,085
 Waiver of Premiums in iProtect only happens in case of accidental total permanent disabilities,

36
00:03:29,085 --> 00:03:31,805
 but other players also include critical illnesses.

37
00:03:31,805 --> 00:03:38,885
 Although ICICI covers a good number of illnesses, the critical illness payout is deducted from your base sum assured.

38
00:03:39,225 --> 00:03:41,565
 So, is iPretect worth the money?

39
00:03:41,865 --> 00:03:46,025
 Not if you're looking for riders like waiver of premiums or critical illness cover.

40
00:03:46,285 --> 00:03:53,165
 But if you want a pure term plan at economical rates and from a good company, this is a good option.

41
00:03:53,625 --> 00:03:55,745
 Plus, it's affordable for smokers.

42
00:03:56,045 --> 00:03:58,625
 Coming to iPretect return of premiums plan.

43
00:03:58,825 --> 00:04:01,285
 First, what is return of premiums?

44
00:04:01,285 --> 00:04:05,585
 Basically, you get your premiums back when the plan matures.

45
00:04:05,585 --> 00:04:09,725
 But this plan would cost you double the premiums for a simple term plan.

46
00:04:09,725 --> 00:04:14,665
 But it's not even worth the money because there is barely any interest on the returned

47
00:04:14,665 --> 00:04:17,965
 money and it doesn't even beat inflation.

48
00:04:17,965 --> 00:04:22,045
 So we don't often recommend a return of premiums plan at Ditto.

49
00:04:22,045 --> 00:04:23,685
 However, let's check it out.

50
00:04:23,685 --> 00:04:26,785
 iProtect Drop offers three variants.

51
00:04:26,785 --> 00:04:31,985
 One is return of premiums where you get back your premiums when the plan ends.

52
00:04:31,985 --> 00:04:37,625
 Second is income benefit which means you get back premiums in form of regular income once

53
00:04:37,625 --> 00:04:38,905
 you turn 60.

54
00:04:38,905 --> 00:04:55,327
 Third is life stage cover where your summer short increases by 5 every year till age 55 Maximum it can get is double and you get the premiums back after maturity This plan doesn offer any inbuilt add like waiver of premiums

55
00:04:55,327 --> 00:05:01,227
 terminal illness etc. but you can get some add-ons like critical illness cover and accidental death

56
00:05:01,227 --> 00:05:07,667
 benefit. Here is a list of riders available and not available in iProtect TROP. Now let's compare

57
00:05:07,667 --> 00:05:14,107
 the premiums of iProtect Smart and iProtect TROP. You can see that the premiums for TROP are

58
00:05:14,107 --> 00:05:20,547
 actually double and as we discussed not worth the returns. Now double premiums and no value for

59
00:05:20,547 --> 00:05:27,167
 money. It's best to go for a simple term plan with required riders. We have done a detailed review of

60
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:33,067
 iProtect Smart on our channel. The link is in the description. And if you have to get your premiums

61
00:05:33,067 --> 00:05:36,587
 back, you can choose the zero-cost option in iProtect Smart.

62
00:05:36,587 --> 00:05:41,107
 Apart from that, is there any problem with ICICI Prudential as a company?

63
00:05:41,387 --> 00:05:44,887
 Yes, it's not serviceable in a few Indian PIN codes.

64
00:05:45,047 --> 00:05:46,407
 So, what does Ditto recommend?

65
00:05:46,707 --> 00:05:50,587
 Well, ICICI Prudential as a company is great, no doubt.

66
00:05:51,047 --> 00:05:55,967
 And if you're looking for a term plan with them, iProtect Smart might be a good pick.

67
00:05:56,087 --> 00:05:58,467
