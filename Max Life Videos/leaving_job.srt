 and feels like the best part of the job.

4
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:11,060
 You feel like you've got it all covered,

5
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,660
 until one day, you think about quitting.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,200
 So, what happens then?

7
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:17,840
 Hi there folks, welcome back to Ditto Insurance.

8
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,300
 If you're new here, I'm Shashank from Ditto.

9
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:24,860
 And in today's video, we talk about something that doesn't get enough attention.

10
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:29,940
 How to convert your corporate health insurance into a personal individual plan.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,600
 Here's what you can expect from this video.

12
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:34,220
 We'll break down what corporate cover really offers,

13
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,800
 why it may not be enough,

14
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,500
 when and how to switch over to an individual plan,

15
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:41,820
 and the benefits you carry forward during the transition.

16
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:47,280
 And by the end, you'll have a clarity on whether making this shift makes sense for you or not.

17
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:50,600

 And yes, our services are completely free of cost.

22
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,100
 Alright, let's start with the basics.

23
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:04,800
 No points for guessing.

24
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:08,720
 Corporate health insurance is usually provided by your employer.

25
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:13,660
 It's easy, doesn't need any medical tests, has no waiting periods,

26
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:16,140
 and often includes family coverage as well.

27
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:18,140
 Sounds amazing, right?

28
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:19,900
 But here's the catch.

29
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,880
 It's tied to your job.

30
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:26,180
 The moment you leave or retire, it's gone.

31
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:29,680
 and that leaves you vulnerable unless you have a backup.

32
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,680
 So, when should you consider switching from corporate to an individual plan?

33
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,680
 And more importantly, is it even possible?

34
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,680
 Yes, it is.

35
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,680
 According to IRDAI guidelines,

36
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:55,206
 you can migrate from your corporate health insurance to an individual policy But there a condition It depends on whether your insurer allows it in the first place so you need to check with your hr or insurer first now let me walk you through the

37
00:01:55,206 --> 00:02:01,606
 actual steps of converting your corporate health insurance into your individual one step one

38
00:02:01,606 --> 00:02:08,566
 confirm if your insurer allows migration not all do so this is very crucial step two

39
00:02:08,566 --> 00:02:13,766
 Put in your request before leaving the job, ideally at least 30 to 45 days in advance.

40
00:02:14,026 --> 00:02:16,906
 This gives everyone enough time to process the switch.

41
00:02:17,206 --> 00:02:21,286
 Step 3. Review and compare the plans your insurer offers.

42
00:02:21,726 --> 00:02:26,406
 Even though you'll stick to the same insurer, you might have options with different benefits.

43
00:02:26,946 --> 00:02:28,546
 Choose one that works for you.

44
00:02:28,546 --> 00:02:30,466
 Step 4. Submit the paperwork.

45
00:02:30,466 --> 00:02:38,466
 This includes your policy details, claim history, KYC documents and a resignation letter or proof of your last working day.

46
00:02:38,466 --> 00:02:42,466
 Step 5, pay the premium for your new individual plan.

47
00:02:42,466 --> 00:02:51,466
 And Step 6, once everything checks out, your insurer will issue the new policy and you will receive confirmation with the continuity benefits.

48
00:02:51,466 --> 00:02:54,466
 Now, if you are thinking, wait, what continuity benefits?

49
00:02:54,466 --> 00:02:56,466
 Well, here's the thing.

50
00:02:56,466 --> 00:03:01,466
 If you've already served part of waiting periods under your corporate plan, that counts.

51
00:03:01,926 --> 00:03:05,326
 Let's say your corporate plan had a 3-year waiting period for a health condition

52
00:03:05,326 --> 00:03:07,306
 and you've already done 2 years,

53
00:03:07,426 --> 00:03:11,426
 in the new individual policy, you'll only need to wait for one more year.

54
00:03:11,906 --> 00:03:13,686
 Now, that is a huge win.

55
00:03:13,926 --> 00:03:17,646
 Now, quick reminder, if you want help comparing plans, understanding paperwork

56
00:03:17,646 --> 00:03:22,146
 or even knowing if your insurer allows the switch, you can book a free call with Ditto.

57
00:03:22,146 --> 00:03:29,226
 Our advisors are IRDI certified and will help explain everything in simple plain language.

58
00:03:29,226 --> 00:03:31,026
 The link is in the description.

59
00:03:31,026 --> 00:03:43,992
 Now here are a few things you should absolutely keep in mind before porting One see timing is everything You must request a conversion within the insurer deadline usually before your last working day

60
00:03:44,172 --> 00:03:47,552
 2. You must stay with the same insurer while migrating.

61
00:03:47,552 --> 00:03:50,552
 That is why it's called migrating and not porting.

62
00:03:51,252 --> 00:03:55,312
 3. Benefits like waiting period credits and bonuses may carry forward,

63
00:03:55,692 --> 00:03:57,172
 but check this beforehand.

64
00:03:57,432 --> 00:03:59,152
 4. Coverage may differ.

65
00:03:59,612 --> 00:04:02,412
 Corporate plans are cheaper because your employer chips in,

66
00:04:02,412 --> 00:04:04,732
 but they often come with limited flexibility.

67
00:04:05,112 --> 00:04:08,612
 Individual plans are more customizable and that brings us to our next point.

68
00:04:09,472 --> 00:04:13,912
 Let me give you a quick snapshot of how corporate and individual health insurance differ.

69
00:04:14,432 --> 00:04:17,432
 Now, I know you're going to tell me, Shashank, I know this,

70
00:04:17,752 --> 00:04:21,472
 but stick around and you'll know exactly why you need to have a retail plan.

71
00:04:21,672 --> 00:04:23,772
 Corporate health insurance is like group deal.

72
00:04:24,072 --> 00:04:25,832
 You get it because you're part of the company.

73
00:04:26,132 --> 00:04:29,432
 It usually kicks in from day one, sometimes covers dependents,

74
00:04:29,432 --> 00:04:32,572
 and the premiums are either fully or partially paid by your employer.

75
00:04:32,932 --> 00:04:33,872
 But what is the catch?

76
00:04:34,272 --> 00:04:38,452
 You have zero control over the coverage and it disappears the moment you leave the job.

77
00:04:38,632 --> 00:04:41,652
 Individual health insurance, on the other hand, is your personal plan.

78
00:04:41,912 --> 00:04:43,372
 You choose the summer insurer.

79
00:04:43,652 --> 00:04:47,912
 The benefits, the add-ons, basically it's built around your needs.

80
00:04:48,112 --> 00:04:50,972
 The premium might be higher, but the coverage stays with you.

81
00:04:51,372 --> 00:04:52,432
 Job or no job.

82
00:04:52,432 --> 00:04:57,312
 Plus, you can renew it for life, which makes it way more reliable in the longer run.

83
00:04:57,312 --> 00:05:01,072
 So, what are the actual advantages of converting to an individual plan?

84
00:05:01,072 --> 00:05:03,472
 First, you maintain continuous coverage.

85
00:05:03,472 --> 00:05:06,872
 No coverage gap when you leave your job or take a break.

86
00:05:06,872 --> 00:05:11,072
 Second, you don't lose progress on waiting periods for pre-existing diseases.

87
00:05:11,072 --> 00:05:12,792
 Third, you get flexibility.

88
00:05:12,792 --> 00:05:16,072
 Add riders like maternity, OPD or consumables cover

89
00:05:16,072 --> 00:05:18,072
 and choose a higher sum insured if you like.

90
00:05:18,072 --> 00:05:21,232
 And finally, you gain independence.
