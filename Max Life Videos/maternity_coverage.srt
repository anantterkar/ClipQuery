1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,960
 Starting a family is beautiful, but in cities like Mumbai, Delhi or Bengaluru, it can always

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:07,960
 be expensive.

3
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:11,280
 A normal delivery can cost 25,000 rupees to a lakh.

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,000
 A c-section, easily 50,000 to 1.25 lakhs.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,120
 And that's not counting ultrasounds, medications, NIC or postnatal care.

6
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:28,760
 So here's the question, does your health insurance cover any of this?

7
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:32,520

14
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:54,280
 First, what does maternity insurance cover?

15
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:57,000
 Now, this is what most people get confused with.

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,680
 So here it goes.

17
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:04,320
 Most maternity add-ons today cover normal and c-section delivery costs, hospital charges,

18
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:10,360
 room rent, doctor and nursing fees, prenatal checkups, scans, medications, usually 30 to

19
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:15,760
 60 days before delivery, postnatal care and medications, typically 60 to 90 days after

20
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:21,520
 delivery, newborn cover for the first 90 days, NIC cause and sometimes congenital disease

21
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,120
 treatment as well.

22
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:27,840
 Some advanced plans may even cover IVF treatments, serogasy or stem cell preservation.

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,240
 But folks, there are limitations.

24
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,880
 Waiting period is the first one.

25
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:35,840
 Most plans have a two to four year wait before you can claim maternity.

26
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,360
 There is also sublimit.

27
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:41,560
 Many policies cap the claim amount, for example, 50,000 or one lakh rupee max.

28
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:44,560
 There's also something called as dual spouse condition.

29
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,600
 And this is interesting.

30
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,760
 So listen to this.

31
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:51,720
 In many plans, both partners must be covered to activate maternity benefits.

32
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,360
 Next is the high premium.

33
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,560
 These plans cost more.

34
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,080
 And if maternity is an add on, check if it can be removed later.

35
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:01,480
 So the question is, should you even buy a maternity plan?

36
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,480
 Not always.

37
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:06,880
 First check, do you or your spouse already have corporate insurance because most corporate

38
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,880
 health policies offer better maternity benefits.

39
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:13,240
 They have shorter or zero waiting periods in most policies.

40
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,000
 They don't charge extra.

41
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 In fact, if either partner has a corporate plan, that should be your first option.

42
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:24,520
 But if you're planning ahead and don't have corporate cover, then yes, buying a personal

43
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:27,680
 policy with maternity benefits may make early sense.

44
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,760
 But here are some things to check before you buy.

45
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,160
 What is the waiting period?

46
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,860
 What's the sublimit on maternity?

47
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:36,560
 Is IVF or surrogacy covered if needed?

48
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,000
 What's covered for the baby?

49
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 Vaccinations?

50
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 NICU?

51
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,260
 Can you remove the add on after the baby is born?

52
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:44,920
 Because you don't want to keep paying the extra premium.

53
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:49,960
 And remember, vitamins, supplements, voluntary terminations and cosmetic procedures are not

54
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 covered.

55
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,760
 Ectopic pregnancy is usually covered under the base health plan, not maternity.

56
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,680
 So what's the final thought?

57
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,960
 If you're planning a family in the next 2-3 years, start evaluating your options now.

58
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:06,800
 Buy early to get past the waiting period, compare corporate vs personal cover and always

59
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,400
 read the fine print around sublimits and exclusions.

60
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,800
 But folks, if you need help with any of this, book a free call with Ditto.

61
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,960
 We'll guide you with zero spam and zero pressure to buy.

62
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:20,740
 In the next episode, we'll talk about OPD coverage and whether it's really worth paying

63
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:21,740
 extra for.

64
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:23,440
 Until then, happy insurance hunting.
