[0.00 - 3.88] Starting a family is beautiful.
[3.88 - 8.12] But in cities like Mumbai, Delhi or Bengaluru, it can always be expensive.
[8.12 - 11.32] A normal delivery can cost Rs. 25,000 to a lakh.
[11.32 - 15.04] A C-section, easily Rs. 50,000 to Rs. 1.25 lakhs.
[15.04 - 19.16] And that's not counting ultrasound, medications and IC or postnatal care.
[19.16 - 20.68] So here's the question.
[20.68 - 28.72] Does your health insurance cover any of this?

[51.72 - 54.40] First, what does maternity insurance cover?
[54.40 - 57.00] Now, this is what most people get confused with.
[57.00 - 58.68] So here it goes.
[58.68 - 63.48] Post-maternity add-ons today cover normal and C-section delivery costs.
[63.48 - 69.44] Hospital charges, room rent, doctor and nursing fees, pre-natal checkups, scans, medications,
[69.44 - 75.44] usually 30 to 60 days before delivery, postnatal care and medications, typically 60 to 90 days
[75.44 - 81.20] after delivery, newborn cover for the first 90 days, NICC cause and sometimes congenital
[81.20 - 83.12] disease treatment as well.
[83.12 - 88.04] Some advanced plans may even cover IVF treatments, surrogacy or stem cell preservation, but
[88.04 - 90.24] folks there are limitations.
[90.24 - 91.88] Waiting period is the first one.
[91.88 - 95.88] Most plans have a 2 to 4 year wait before you can claim maternity.
[95.88 - 97.40] There is also sublimit.
[97.40 - 101.60] Many policies cap the claim amount, for example 50,000 or 1 lakh rupees max.
[101.60 - 105.88] There's also something called as dual spouse condition and this is interesting, so listen
[105.88 - 106.88] to this.
[106.88 - 111.76] In many plans, both partners must be covered to activate maternity benefits.
[111.76 - 113.44] Next is the high premium.
[113.44 - 118.12] These plans cost more and if maternity is an add-on, check if it can be removed later.
[118.12 - 121.56] So the question is should even buy a maternity plan?
[121.56 - 122.56] Not always.
[122.56 - 126.92] First check, do you or your spouse already have corporate insurance because most corporate
[126.92 - 129.92] health policies offer better maternity benefits.
[129.92 - 133.32] They have shorter or zero waiting periods in most policies.
[133.32 - 135.04] They don't charge extra.
[135.04 - 140.04] In fact if either partner has a corporate plan, that should be your first option.
[140.44 - 144.88] If you're planning ahead and don't have corporate cover, then yes, buying a personal policy
[144.88 - 147.68] with maternity benefits may make early sense.
[147.68 - 150.76] But here are some things to check before you buy.
[150.76 - 152.12] What is the waiting period?
[152.12 - 153.88] What's the sublimit on maternity?
[153.88 - 156.52] Is IVF or Sarogecy covered if needed?
[156.52 - 158.12] What's covered for the baby?
[158.12 - 159.12] Vaccinations?
[159.12 - 160.12] And I see you.
[160.12 - 162.28] Can you remove the add-on after the baby is born?
[162.28 - 164.92] Because you don't want to keep paying the extra premium.
[164.92 - 169.84] And remember, vitamins, supplements, voluntary terminations and cosmetic procedures are
[169.84 - 170.84] not covered.
[170.84 - 175.76] Ectopic pregnancy is usually covered under the base health plan, not maternity.
[175.76 - 177.64] So what's the final thought?
[177.64 - 181.96] If you're planning a family in the next 2-3 years, start evaluating your options now.
[181.96 - 186.76] Buy early to get past the waiting period, compare corporate versus personal cover and always
[186.76 - 190.36] read the fine print around sublimits and exclusions.
[190.36 - 194.16] But folks, if you need help with any of this, book a free call with Ditto.
[194.16 - 196.96] We'll guide you with zero spam and zero pressure to buy.
[196.96 - 200.76] In the next episode, we'll talk about OPD coverage and whether it's really worth paying
[200.76 - 201.76] extra for.
[201.76 - 203.44] Until then, happy in charge and sounding.
