1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 You get treated, you submitted the bill and your insurer paid you. Only half? Yes, that actually happens.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
 And when you ask the insurer why, they'll usually point to something buried deep in your policy document.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
 It's called as reasonable and customary clause and it's one of those tricky things that sounds innocent

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 but can hit you with unexpected out-of-pocket costs when you least expect it.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000

 In this video, I'm going to walk you through what this clause actually means,

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,920
 means, how it works and how you can avoid getting burned by it. And if at any point you feel

8
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,340
 overwhelmed or unsure about your current plan, just pause and book a free call with a link in

 bio. We'll help you decode this clause and your entire health policy, no spam and with no pressure

10
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:46,140
 to buy. Again, the link is in the description. Alright, let's jump into it. So what exactly is

11
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:50,860
 reasonable and customary clause anyway? Think of it like this. You go in for a routine surgery,

12
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:55,200
 the doctor's good, the hospital's clean, the treatment is successful. But later,

13
00:00:55,200 --> 00:01:00,620
 when you file for reimbursement, your insurer says, hey, we're only going to cover 2.5 lakh

14
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:06,900
 rupees out of the 4 lakh bill. Why? Now, because according to their data, 2.5 lakh rupees is what

15
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:12,980
 this surgery typically costs in your city, in your area. That extra 1.5 lakh rupees, not their

16
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:18,160
 problem. That, my friend, is now yours. And that's exactly what the reasonable and customary clause

17
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:33,127
 allows them to do This clause gives your insurer the power to cap your reimbursement based on what what they consider a fair or standard price for a treatment Doesn matter what the hospital charged if they feel it excessive they limit their payout It all about managing costs and to be fair it helps control

18
00:01:33,127 --> 00:01:37,707
 inflated billing. But as policyholder, it can leave you with a nasty surprise unless you know

19
00:01:37,707 --> 00:01:42,567
 what you're walking into. Okay, but how does this clause actually work in practice? So let's assume

20
00:01:42,567 --> 00:01:47,307
 when you make a claim, especially a reimbursement one, your insurer does a few checks. First,

21
00:01:47,307 --> 00:01:51,927
 they'll look at the rate card from your similar hospitals in your area. If your hospital rates

22
00:01:51,927 --> 00:01:56,127
 are way above the average, they'll flag it. Second, they'll see if the treatment protocol

23
00:01:56,127 --> 00:02:00,727
 followed by your hospital was standard. For example, if you were given five scans and two

24
00:02:00,727 --> 00:02:05,207
 specialists for a condition that normally needs one doctor and one scan, the insurer can call it

25
00:02:05,207 --> 00:02:10,187
 non-customary. Third, they'll examine what was billed. Sometimes hospitals add unnecessary

26
00:02:10,187 --> 00:02:14,947
 consumables or extra stuffing. And if those don't align with the usual standards, your claim gets

27
00:02:14,947 --> 00:02:19,907
 punched. And here's the catch. These checks are internal. The insurer decides what's reasonable

28
00:02:19,907 --> 00:02:24,407
 based on their own data. We don't have access to their benchmark rates and those limits vary

29
00:02:24,407 --> 00:02:29,287
 from one insurer to another. Now, you might be wondering, does this apply to every claim?

30
00:02:29,427 --> 00:02:34,527
 Thankfully, no. This clause is mostly applied to reimbursement claims and not cashless ones.

31
00:02:34,647 --> 00:02:38,627
 That's because in cashless claims, your insurer already has a prefix rate agreement with the

32
00:02:38,627 --> 00:02:43,467
 hospital. So, pricing disputes don't really come up. But if you go to non-network hospital,

33
00:02:43,467 --> 00:02:55,754
 pay out of pocket and then submit bills then that where this clause can bite you hard So if you want to minimize the risk of this happening always and I mean always opt for cashless treatment at a network hospital whenever possible

34
00:02:55,914 --> 00:02:59,174
 Now, why do insurers even use this clause? What's in it for them?

35
00:02:59,254 --> 00:03:01,734
 The biggest reason is simple, to prevent overbilling.

36
00:03:01,874 --> 00:03:05,994
 If insurers blindly pay every inflated bill from every overpriced hospital,

37
00:03:06,214 --> 00:03:08,534
 premiums would shoot through the roof for everyone.

38
00:03:08,674 --> 00:03:12,534
 This clause gives them a way to say, we'll pay what's fair, not what's padded.

39
00:03:12,534 --> 00:03:14,734
 It also ensures uniform pricing standards.

40
00:03:14,994 --> 00:03:18,574
 So two customers undergoing the same treatment in the same city

41
00:03:18,574 --> 00:03:22,954
 don't have wildly different claim experiences just because they went to different hospitals.

42
00:03:23,154 --> 00:03:25,954
 Now, from a cost control angle, this makes sense.

43
00:03:26,214 --> 00:03:29,954
 But from your side, it's one more reason to carefully read your policy

44
00:03:29,954 --> 00:03:32,694
 and know which hospitals are part of your network.

45
00:03:32,814 --> 00:03:34,714
 You will get this list on the insurer's website.

46
00:03:34,894 --> 00:03:37,454
 Now, what if you're hit with this clause unfairly?

47
00:03:37,834 --> 00:03:38,654
 What can you do?

48
00:03:38,714 --> 00:03:41,234
 If your insurer uses this clause to reduce your claim

49
00:03:41,234 --> 00:03:43,994
 and you believe the treatment cost was justified,

50
00:03:44,314 --> 00:03:46,054
 you have the right to challenge it.

51
00:03:46,154 --> 00:03:47,374
 And this is what you can do.

52
00:03:47,494 --> 00:03:48,334
 Gather documents.

53
00:03:48,454 --> 00:03:51,194
 Get a detailed breakup of the bill supporting doctor notes

54
00:03:51,194 --> 00:03:54,394
 and proof that the treatment was necessary indeed.

55
00:03:54,534 --> 00:03:59,574
 Second, get second estimates from other hospitals in the same area for the same treatment.

56
00:03:59,774 --> 00:04:03,114
 Now, all you got to do is submit everything to the insurer's grievance cell

57
00:04:03,114 --> 00:04:04,994
 and request a reassessment.

58
00:04:04,994 --> 00:04:06,834
 If they still refuse to revise the payout,

59
00:04:07,114 --> 00:04:19,021
 you can escalate the case to the IRDAI And yes they do take these complaints quite seriously if you have solid documentation But just one thing to remember as per IDI regulations insurers are allowed to invoke

60
00:04:19,021 --> 00:04:21,441
 this clause only if they can prove overbilling.

61
00:04:21,561 --> 00:04:24,861
 So the burden is on them, not you, to justify the cut.

62
00:04:24,981 --> 00:04:27,001
 So folks, what is the takeaway here?

63
00:04:27,081 --> 00:04:29,481
 The reasonable and customary clause isn't illegal.

64
00:04:29,681 --> 00:04:30,921
 It is not a scam.

65
00:04:31,081 --> 00:04:33,001
 It's just a pricing control mechanism.

66
00:04:33,141 --> 00:04:37,341
 But I agree, it can leave you with a surprise bill, especially if you're unaware if your

67
00:04:37,341 --> 00:04:41,981
 treatment happens outside the network. So the smartest thing that you can do is stick to Network

68
00:04:41,981 --> 00:04:46,601
 Hospital for cashless claims. Understand your insurer's pricing benchmarks as much as you can.

69
00:04:46,701 --> 00:04:51,661
 And most importantly, talk to someone who can help you decode this upfront. You won't face this issue
