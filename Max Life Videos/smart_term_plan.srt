00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,260
 Hi folks, welcome to Ditto Insurance. I'm Shashank, your host and today we are back

2
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:12,560
 with yet another amazing video for you. This is one of those videos that you've been waiting

3
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:18,240
 for and have asked us time and again. Well, Axis Max Life Insurance has released one of

4
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:24,400
 their newest plans. It's a term plan and it has tons of features in it. Now, to discuss

5
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:29,280
 this in detail, I have with me in the studio, Sushant, who is our Senior Program Manager

6
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:35,680
 here at Ditto. So, I'll hand over the whole stage to you, the whole studio to you, because

7
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:41,760
 I would love for you to take us over through all the variants and all the features and

8
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:46,640
 how different Axis Max Life is doing with this STPP plan.

9
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:52,200
 Okay, Percy, thanks for having me once again. It's quite an interesting plan. For the rest

10
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:58,000
 of this video, the plan's name is Smart Term Plan Plus, but we'll be calling it STPP for

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,160
 your sake of convenience. But yes, I think the interesting bit here that they've done

12
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,640
 is the number of variants that they have. They're pretty much trying to cater to any

13
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:11,880
 and every kind of requirement you could possibly have. They're also thinking of any possible

14
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:16,080
 scenario. They're thinking of plans where you have more focus on an accident cover and

15
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,720
 less on your initial death benefit. They have cases where in the initial few years, your

16
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:24,800
 cover amount is really high, but after that it reduces. They have a type of plan where

17
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:28,960
 you get back your money in between, towards the end and so on. So, I'll try my best to

18
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:33,680
 simplify it and cover all of them in a brief, structured sort of way. But with that, let's

19
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:39,760
 get started. Before we begin though, just to let everyone know, earlier in the previous

20
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:45,220
 variant, Max Life used to offer a 12% discount in the first year for salaried customers.

21
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:50,520
 In this plan, they've made it a 15% discount for the first year, which is a plus. But from

22
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:54,440
 the second year onwards, in comparison to the previous plan, there's an increase of

23
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:59,720
 about 2% to 4%. So, Max Life is getting a bit more expensive. But nonetheless, like

24
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:03,480
 I mentioned, the features that they're offering do make a compelling case for the premiums

25
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:08,160
 that they're charging. Perfect. So, I think with that, let's get started. The first one

26
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:13,480
 would be our primary recommendation, the most basic balanced cover plan. This is your regular

27
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:18,240
 old-term plan, right? There's really not much to it. The minimum age to buy this plan is

28
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:23,520
 18, the maximum is 60. Cover amounts of your choosing, I think it starts at about 50 lakhs

29
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:28,720
 and can go up to at least 20-30 crores. They offer payment in years, like you have a single

30
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:33,960
 pay option where you can pay all your premiums within one year, or you can pay a limited

31
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:38,520
 pay just for 5-10 years or even a regular pay. So, like I mentioned, this is a pretty

32
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:43,280
 basic term plan. So, at least this variant of it is the basic term plan. So, I don't

33
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,720
 want to dwell on this too much. The next one, which is a bit interesting, is called the

34
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:51,200
 rebalancing cover if I'm not wrong. So, this is the second variant. It's not something

35
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:56,800
 I would actively recommend, but no harm in simplifying it. So, how this works is your

36
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:04,360
 term plan will have a split of 10% and 90%, meaning 10% of basic death cover, 90% accident

37
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:09,320
 death cover. So, what this means is if I buy a 2-crore plan, my cover amount will start

38
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:13,960
 off with 20 lakhs of death benefit and 1.8 crores of accidental death benefit. And over

39
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,120
 the span of my entire term insurance, my accident cover will get rebalanced, wherein it will

40
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:24,520
 go all the way down to zero and my main death benefit will go all the way up to 2 crores.

41
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:27,840
 This might be helpful, like if I were to think about, right, that who are they trying to

42
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:33,200
 cater to for this? Maybe that sector of audience whose lifestyle or hobbies are such, or maybe

43
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,800
 their job right now such that they travel a lot. They're a lot more prone to accidents

44
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:41,280
 and that's maybe the current scenario. But over the span of 20-30 years, as their career

45
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:46,360
 progresses, as life progresses, they're planning to cut that down and focus more on the actual

46
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:51,200
 death cover as opposed to the accident part. So, like I said, not a very common use case,

47
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:55,120
 not something I think a lot of people would be rushing to buy, but it's still interesting

48
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:59,800
 for them to have come up with something like this. Another point to note for this particular

49
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:05,160
 plan and why I maybe do like it a little bit is the fact that underwriting will only happen

50
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:10,120
 for 50% of the sum in short. So, let's say if I as an individual cannot buy more than

51
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:15,040
 1 crore of term insurance, through this plan I can buy 2 crores actually. I need to be

52
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,880
 just eligible for one and they'll give me two. But with the caveat that look I start

53
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:24,080
 off with 20 lakhs of credit, death benefit and towards the end I eventually become eligible

54
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,800
 for 2 crores. So, like I said, it's got a mix of features.

55
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:32,840
 Do you see people getting this plan more than the basic plan?

56
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:35,640
 Not really, no. Very rare case scenario.

57
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:39,040
 Alright, Sushant, before we head to the third variant, I'd like to tell our audience a little

58
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:43,960
 about Ditto. So folks, Ditto is an insurance advisory platform where you can get free health

62
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:05,080

64
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:15,560
 assign an IRDI certified advisor to you under two minutes. With that said, Sushant, let's

65
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,560
 get back.

66
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:21,960
 Cool, so I think the third variant now is something called early return of premium.

67
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:27,080
 Now this as the name suggests, if it has return of premium in it, Ditto is very against it

68
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:31,360
 and for pretty obvious reasons. I think return of premium plans are never worth it. If you

69
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:37,680
 actually calculate the financial outflow, meaning my basic term plan cost me 20,000

70
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,200
 but the return of premium plan would cost me at least 30-35,000. Now that additional

71
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:45,800
 outflow, instead of giving it to the insurance company, if I were to go and invest it even

72
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:50,080
 in something as simple as an FD, I would make a lot more money by the end of this tenure.

73
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,760
 The insurance company is simply going to pay me back all my premiums and nothing else.

74
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:57,480
 So yeah, early return of premium is a bit interesting in the sense they don't give it

75
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 at the end of it. What they do is they give you 50% of your premiums once you turn 60

76
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,600
 and the remaining 50% at the end of the policy tenure. So maybe they're just trying to do

77
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:12,000
 something a bit different from the traditional ROP but nonetheless, like I said, it's not

78
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,720
 something we would ever recommend or ever suggest. It really doesn't make financial

79
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,720
 sense.

80
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:21,780
 Right, makes sense. So now let's head to the fourth variant.

81
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:25,960
 This I think is probably one of my favorites in this plan and it's also Ditto's secondary

82
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:30,240
 recommendation after the primary most basic plan. This is the one I would probably go

83
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:35,440
 on as a second benefit. So this one is actually called Smart Cover and this is Ditto's secondary

84
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:40,640
 recommendation after the primary one being a balanced regular term plan. And I did kind

85
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:43,800
 of like this plan. I thought it was interesting what they've done here. So what MaxLife is

86
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:48,320
 essentially done here is that they're offering a plan where for the first 15 years of your

87
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:54,520
 term insurance, your sum insured is boosted by 50%. So let's say if I bought a 2 crore

88
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:59,080
 term plan, for the first 15 years I will have a 3 crore term plan. And after that for

89
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:02,080
 the rest of my tenure, it will come back down to 2 crores.

90
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:06,520
 Okay, this is interesting. Why do you think they're giving us an accelerated, you know,

91
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,640
 higher sum insured?

92
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:12,440
 So this I think is for people who have financial responsibilities right now. For example, you've

93
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:16,640
 got a home loan running, you've got an education loan running, but you also foresee that look,

94
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:20,840
 15 years later I'm building my savings and investments parallelly. 15 years later I might

95
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:26,080
 not need this much term insurance or I might not have that extra 1 crore of financial liability.

96
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:29,640
 So it depends on profile to profile. But like I said, broadly these are the ones we've seen

97
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:36,080
 where people who have liabilities or responsibilities upfront, to them maybe it makes sense. But

98
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:42,000
 I think the interesting part here was in case I buy a 3 crore plan directly versus this plan,

99
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,240
 I will save about 20% in premiums.

100
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:51,280
 So there's a reason why it's Dito's recommendation. In your eyes, why do you think it is one of

101
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,000
 the recommendations? Do you think people should consider this?

102
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,600
 Look, like I said, it's our secondary recommendation. It's never going to be my primary. I would

103
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:01,880
 always still rely on our level term insurance cover, which in fact, we even help you arrive

104
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:06,120
 at how much you need, right? We look at inflation, we have an NPV calculator that we help you

105
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:10,040
 decide how much insurance you should take. This being a secondary recommendation, because

106
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:14,800
 look, it's specific for people who are one, if you're confident on your financial planning,

107
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,880
 like I said, you're sure that 15 years later, you will have the savings and investments

108
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:22,560
 that you thought you would, right? Wherein you're providing the family the safety net

109
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,720
 through that as well. And two, you're also confident that in 15 years, your liabilities

110
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:31,320
 will be taken care of. The additional responsibilities you have right now will not be there 15 to

111
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:36,280
 20 years later. Because once you buy this, the plan is going to, I mean, this reduction

112
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:40,040
 will happen by default. It's not something that you can later tap out of saying, hey,

113
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:43,720
 actually, can you give me three crore for life? They can't do that. You've opted for

114
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:50,040
 that variant. Yeah, like I said, it's a recommendation, but a secondary recommendation.

115
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:56,480
 I think we've gotten four in our basket up until now. And I already see a variation of

116
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:02,000
 a return of premium, the basic plan, the basic plan with little toppings. I mean, I don't

117
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,280
 think that there is anything more that Axis Max Life could do. Or do you want to prove

118
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:11,960
 me wrong? They have a bit. Look, the next couple of variants are variations of ROP.

119
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:16,720
 So I think I can just cover those quickly. We don't really recommend those. So I'll just

120
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,880
 go over them real quick. So the next one is actually a combination of a whole life and

121
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:26,240
 an ROP plan. A whole life plan meaning you buy a term insurance till the age of 99 or

122
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,920
 100. So this one's till the age of 100. Now, this isn't like your traditional whole life

123
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:36,160
 plans offered by, let's say, ICICI, Protector. I think even Bajaj Itaq has this option. This

124
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:40,080
 isn't like that. This comes with a mandatory ROP option as well. So in this plan, 50% of

125
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:45,880
 your premiums are paid after you turn 60. And the remaining 50% is paid in case you

126
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:51,120
 live out until 100. And if not, then should someone pass away, let's say at 70 or 75,

127
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:55,760
 his family will get the claim amount and the remaining 50% of his premiums. They will pay

128
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:59,640
 that back. So this, like I said, it's a bit complicated in terms of this combination of

129
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:05,240
 whole life and ROP. As a concept, these are two variants that I again would never genuinely

130
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:09,200
 advise to someone, considering the caveats that they come with, the additional premium

131
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:13,720
 you pay and just as a concept, right? I mean, buying a life insurance for a whole life is

132
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:18,120
 kind of like trying to buy money back plan. And an insurer is aware of this. So they're

133
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:22,160
 going to charge you exorbitant premiums to make sure that they're not just handing out

134
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:26,640
 two, three crores of claims. They'll collect that much premium over a span invested and

135
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:31,560
 make sure they have the money ready for you. So rather than that, why not buy a traditional

136
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,960
 term plan and do your own investments on the side?

137
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:37,960
 Exactly. I think a lot of people are unaware about the fact that, you know, whole life

138
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:43,840
 insurance is very different from term insurance. So folks, if you are one of them, and if you

139
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:48,560
 end up buying or even considering an option, the first option, in fact, which comes on

140
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:56,400
 your Instagram ad or even your Facebook wall, so maybe, maybe halt and pause and come over

141
00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:02,120
 to Rito's channel. We have made tons of videos where we've explained why a whole life insurance

142
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:07,160
 plan might not be the best one for you. Well, in any case, if you want a direct call with

00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:22,080
 you so that you can protect your family and live life brindas.

146
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:28,600
 Now, Sushant, let's go over the last two variants. I'm pretty, I mean, I don't know what I would

147
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,600
 call it. I'm looking forward to it.

148
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:36,960
 Right. So the sixth variant again is a traditional ROP variant, Plain and Simple Return of Premium.

149
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:40,200
 Not like the previous where there's a whole life or there's an early return. This is just

150
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:45,360
 traditional return of premium. Again, I think the premiums itself will speak for themselves.

151
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:50,320
 Let's say for 30 year old male was buying a 3 crore plan for a span of 30 years, so

152
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:56,360
 till his age of 60. Traditionally, his term insurance should cost him about 30,000, but

153
00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:01,480
 under this variant, his plan will cost him 90,000. So that's a 200% traditional outflow

154
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:05,480
 in premiums. And our logic is the same, right? That additional outflow, we're assuming you

155
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:09,400
 have the money to spend, right? If you're buying a plan like this, you do have the 90,000.

156
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:13,960
 So why not pay the insurance company 30 and diversify the remaining 60? Put some in an

157
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:19,680
 FD, some mutual funds, buy some gold for your kids, whatever, right? Sky's the limit. So

158
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:24,120
 you could do whatever you'd like with that. Perfect. So needless to say, this is not one

159
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:28,520
 of our recommendations. Cool. So the last variant is called the income protection option.

160
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:34,000
 Now, this one is more for the nominees wherein when the claim happens, should someone pass

161
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,440
 away and his family applies for the claim, the money will be dispersed in an income form.

162
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:43,000
 It won't be given to them as a lump sum. Now, right off the bat, this feature is something

163
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,680
 that, look, we personally don't actively recommend because we would rather the family get the

164
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:52,840
 entire lump sum, right? Reason being that they have control over such a large amount

165
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:56,720
 wherein should they have some immediate lump sum expenses coming up? Should there be a

166
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:01,000
 loan that's running and they wish to just simply clear it off? Should there be major

167
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,440
 expenses coming up like kids' education, marriage, and so on? You'd like to have that lump sum

168
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:09,160
 with you to pay these off, right? And two, even if there's an emergency in the future

169
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:13,280
 and you need to sort of pay things off, it does help to have control over that two crores

170
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:18,040
 Nonetheless, insurance companies do try and make it as lucrative as possible for them

171
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:22,680
 as well. Some people, in fact, prefer this thing that, look, I'm not sure if my family

172
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:27,560
 will be financially sensible or responsible enough to handle such a large amount. Even

173
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:31,160
 there, I think, are sort of counter to that is, you know, you can simply just open a fixed

174
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:35,520
 deposit in the bank. You walk into a bank and say, hey, I have two crore and just watch

175
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:40,360
 the line that comes to you, right? The line of employees that's after you. But nonetheless,

176
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:45,000
 So what they've done firstly is a level income option, where plain and simple, over a span

177
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,640
 of 10 years at least, you can choose the span as well, but 10 years is the bare minimum,

178
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:54,080
 they will disperse this amount in monthly income format. So 120 installments if I choose

179
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:57,400
 10 years, that's what my two crore, three crore will be divided into and the family

180
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:02,320
 will receive this. So the second part under this is called the inflation proof income

181
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:07,680
 cover. So what they've done here is every three years, the income that your family is

182
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:13,680
 getting will increase by 10% to kind of maybe combat some form of inflation, right? Although

183
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:18,920
 10% every three years, I don't think is even CPI index, right? It's less than that. But

184
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:24,000
 nonetheless, every three years, 10% of income, the income amount will increase. And this

185
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,660
 is capped at 200% of the original income. So if the duration you've chosen is such

186
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:32,700
 that where it can keep increasing every three, three, three years, after eventually when

187
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:37,400
 your income reaches 200%, it will stop increasing, they'll just get a level amount. And this

188
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:42,840
 as many would guess, this variant is more expensive than the level income variant, because

189
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:45,760
 they are essentially offering a higher payout to your family, right? More than what you

190
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:50,240
 kind of purchase. So accordingly, the premiums as well would be a bit more expensive.

191
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,240
 Right.

192
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:55,520
 All in all, just to summarize, I think going over all seven features briefly, there are

193
00:14:55,520 --> 00:15:00,360
 about three of them which are ROP related. So let's just skip those. There's this one,

194
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:05,560
 which is the income format that your family receives. The main three that I would say

195
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:09,960
 is Ditto's primary recommendation, a balance cover. Ditto's secondary recommendation,

196
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:13,400
 which is the boost one, where for the first 15 years, you have a higher sum insured and

197
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:18,520
 then it reduces. And the third one being the balancing one between a regular and an accident,

198
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:23,680
 1090, which reduces eventually. These are, I think, just to summarize, these are the

199
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,560
 variants offered by Max in this plan.

200
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:30,760
 Perfect. Perfect. So I was just thinking while you were explaining it to me, obviously, there

201
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:36,480
 are a couple of riders that you can have which will make your term plan even much better.

202
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:43,280
 But I was just thinking if there are any inbuilt benefits or features that these plans have

203
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:47,720
 that would make people turn their eye towards the STP plan.

204
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:51,360
 Yeah, there are quite a few free benefits actually. I think Maxlife has always been

205
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:56,440
 known for that, where apart from the riders, they do tend to offer a bunch of inbuilt features

206
00:15:56,440 --> 00:16:00,120
 and inbuilt add-ons. And I think that's what really sets them apart, right? At the end

207
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:02,560
 of the day, why they're as popular as they are.

208
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:07,040
 So a couple of basic ones that are from the previous plan as well. I'll just quickly go

209
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:11,640
 over those. You have your Terminal Illness Benefit. This is, I think, where you get a

210
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:16,240
 payout of up to one crore on diagnosis of a terminal illness. And upon demise, if there

211
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,560
 is an additional amount, the balance amount is paid to the family.

212
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:23,880
 The Cover Continuance Benefit. This gives you an option to defer your premium payments

213
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:28,240
 by 12 months. Should you, let's say, be between jobs in the future, right? And you feel, hey,

214
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:32,280
 I don't want to take on this financial responsibility as well. You can simply tell them that, hey,

215
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:35,040
 I'll pay you next year. Just let me be this year.

216
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,040
 Khatme likhna.

217
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:40,600
 Yeah, exactly. So you do have to pay next year, of course. When you go back next year,

218
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:44,680
 they will charge you double for the previous year and the current year. But it just offers

219
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:49,960
 a bit of financial comfort to a person in a time of need. Then you have the Special

220
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:54,400
 Exit Benefit, which is available after 30 years of policy completion and not in the

221
00:16:54,400 --> 00:17:00,000
 last four years. This, again, is a free of cost feature, right? Where whatever premiums

222
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,360
 paid until then up to date, you'll get those back minus GST. So this is called Special

223
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:08,880
 Exit or Early Exit, where should I wish to exit from my term plan earlier, not wait till

224
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,680
 the completion? You can get back some money. And this is free of cost.

225
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:17,000
 Another one that they've had from the previous variant is called the InstaClaim Payout, where

226
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,880
 this is applicable after one year of policy completion. And they have different bands

227
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,000
 for this, that if your covered amount is such, it's only so much. But just to give you a

228
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:29,240
 rough perspective, in case someone's family applies for a claim, and it's been more than

229
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:34,360
 a year since he purchased the plan, they will pay out a very small amount immediately that

230
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:38,280
 day or the next day itself. And the balance amount will be processed after due process

231
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:43,200
 and due diligence of the claims paperwork. This is a very normal amount, up to two lakhs

232
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:47,320
 maximum. If your sum in short is lower, it could even be lower. Like I said, this is

233
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:51,360
 the maximum that they offer. So nonetheless, this could help you with immediate expenses

234
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:57,440
 that come up, maybe taking care of hospital bills in a time like that or anything at all.

235
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:01,600
 So this does help out. So another one here is obviously the price difference between

236
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:06,160
 male and female. Ideally how it was before in the insurance industry was that it was

237
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:10,320
 never clearly defined as a percentage. This was a well-known fact that when you buy life

238
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:15,240
 insurance of the same profile, male and female, same age, same everything, the prices were

239
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:19,720
 different. Now by how much? Sometimes dependent on age and profile and everything. But often

240
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:24,040
 a lot of brands have started standardizing the percentage. So it's now clear that it's

241
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:29,880
 a 15% difference. If a male individual pays X amount, the female of the same age buying

242
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:34,360
 everything else the same, she'll pay about 15% lesser. So that's an advantage that they

243
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:38,400
 get because of mortality rates, plain and simple. A female's life expectancy is a lot

244
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:43,600
 more than a male's. So accordingly, the risk for an insurance company is calculated accordingly.

245
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:47,040
 Now there's a couple of free ones that again stood out to me and I thought they were unique

246
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:52,120
 and I personally like them as well. So the first one is again related to female clients

247
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:57,600
 specifically. It's called the Lifeline Plus Variant. So this one gives a female policy

248
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:04,600
 holder the option to enhance her sum insured post her spouse's demise. Meaning in case

249
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:09,920
 her spouse were to pass away. Ideally she does have more responsibilities on her now, right?

250
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:14,920
 The kid is, you know, the kid's responsibilities, parents and laws, whatever it is. The financial

251
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:20,240
 responsibilities do increase slightly. Therefore they give her the option to modify her existing

252
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:25,640
 term plan itself and increase the cover amount by up to 50% or 50 lakh whichever is lower.

253
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:30,320
 Now this can only be done after at least 3 years of holding the policy and 2 it has to

254
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:34,800
 be done within 6 months to 2 years of the spouse's demise. So they will need proof

255
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:37,800
 of this obviously and accordingly you can show them that hey this is the date it happened

256
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:41,440
 and they'll give you this benefit. This is a well thought benefit. Exactly, I really

257
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:46,240
 thought it was a thoughtful benefit. The last one now is again related to the special

258
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:50,160
 exit benefit but this is specifically for customers who have chosen limited pay as their

259
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:53,600
 payment option. Meaning you're not going to pay for the entire policy 10 years, you're

260
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:58,380
 going to pay for just 5, 10, 15 years. Now what they've done is your regular special

261
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:02,680
 exit plan where you exit the plan early at a predefined moment. You get back all your

262
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:07,560
 premiums minus GST. Here again MaxLife has defined those moments. This might sound a

263
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:11,600
 bit confusing but what they've essentially done is it's either at policy term minus

264
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:17,160
 13 years meaning 13 years before your policy were to expire. So if it were to 70 at 57

265
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:22,920
 is the benefit or its policy term minus 7 years. This depends profile to profile payment

266
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:27,680
 and so on. So I think maybe for specific profiles that advisors can help. And the benefit here

267
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:31,920
 is that you get 200% of your premiums. You don't just get back 100%. So let's say if

268
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:36,840
 you paid them as total of about 5 lakhs you'll get back almost 10 lakhs. That's what you're

269
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:40,440
 eligible for. Like I said the condition when you can get it, it's best you just get in

270
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:44,880
 touch with our advisors and they'll probably guide you based on your profile. And to point

271
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:48,880
 to note this is only available if you've chosen a limited pay. Which in fact is increasing

272
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:52,680
 these days. We're seeing a trend where people are opting for limited pay more and more with

273
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:56,040
 the logic that look the convenience factor of it. We just want to get this done within

274
00:20:56,040 --> 00:21:00,560
 5, 10 years. It's not about whether regular pay versus limited pay what makes more sense.

275
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:04,900
 It's simply about not wanting to have such a long term financial commitment. So they're

276
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:09,100
 okay with paying for 5, 10 years and wrapping this up, letting the policy continue and maybe

277
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:13,820
 20, 30 years later Max Lef says hey would you like to exit and get back 200% of your

278
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:17,940
 premiums. I mean who wouldn't want that? Exactly. It really might make sense to some profiles.

279
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:21,780
 But yeah I think that summarizes the free features as well. Right those are some pretty

280
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:27,580
 great in-bird features. Now I'm excited to see the paid add-ons. What do they look like?

281
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:31,220
 Anything that stood out? So they have the traditional ones your waiver of premium, critical

282
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:35,100
 illness, accidental death. So I'd rather not go into the specifics of those. I think we've

283
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:40,140
 covered those a bunch of times. The one that stood out to me is again this has probably been

284
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:46,460
 picked from like a health insurance plan. It's a maternity benefit. So again it's something specific

285
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:54,500
 for female leads wherein you can claim up to 2 lakhs worth of maternity expenses. So here again

286
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:59,140
 some conditions you have to be between 18 and 40 when you buy this plan. There's a 10 month

287
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:03,300
 waiting period. So from the date of purchase of the plan you can exercise this benefit only after

288
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:07,540
 10 months. That's when this benefit kicks in and this benefit is active only for the span of 5

289
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:13,580
 years. The summer short that they're offering for this is 2 lakhs. Now this isn't bad I think in a

290
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:18,180
 metro city like Bangalore, Delhi in most private hospitals I think maternity shouldn't cost more

291
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:24,180
 than that 2-3 lakhs at most. And in fact in health insurance it's not a feature we recommend. We do

292
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:28,540
 suggest that you rely on your corporate health insurance for this. And again I think we've done

293
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:33,620
 a separate video on this too. But for someone to offer this within term insurance it's the first of

294
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:39,940
 its kind and I do like this. Alright Sushant. Now I think this is the moment that everyone's

295
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:46,860
 been waiting for. Pretty good variance, pretty good plan, pretty good riders that you have and

296
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:53,500
 benefits all nailed. But how much is it going to cost us? So they're actually not bad. I think

297
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:59,900
 Maxlife has always been known to offer competitive premiums with quite solid comprehensive features.

298
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:05,060
 Now like I mentioned at the start of this video in comparison to the previous plan it might be 2 to 4

299
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:11,260
 percent more expensive but they're still quite competitive. So let's take a 25 year old nonsmoker

300
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:18,700
 male buying a 1 crore plan till the age of 65. A 1 crore plan would cost him about 10,000, a 2 crore

301
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:19,540
 plan would cost him about 17,000 and a 3 crore would be about 25,000. Pretty good rates. The next profile for a slightly older individual, a 40 year old male buying it till 65. A 1 crore plan would cost him somewhere about 20,000, a 2 crore plan would be somewhere about 35,000 and a 3 crore is somewhere at about 52,000. So again not bad if you compare it to other insurers out there this is reasonable and quite competitive. So finally before we head towards the end of the video Sushant I want to ask you. You've

302
00:23:48,700 --> 00:24:18,460
 seen many term plans out there. What is your take on Max Life taking back their STEP plan and bringing in STPP? So do you think it's a step up or a step down? Definitely a step up I think because they've maintained some of the good features from STEP and they've brought in a host of new features as well. One thing I particularly liked was a couple of features specifically targeting the female audience. I thought that was quite interesting and thoughtful of them to do.

303
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:30,220
 Additionally offering variants in terms of customization and so on. I thought that was comprehensive as well. The ROP variants of course maybe we're not the happiest with that but you can't be too happy.

304
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:48,220
 Perfect. Thank you so much Sushant for joining us and folks you heard it from the expert himself. So STPP plan is really a good one in the market at the moment. So if you guys want to book a call with us to know more about STPP plan and if it's the right one for you,
