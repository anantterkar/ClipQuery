[0.00 - 7.26]  Hi folks, welcome to Ditto Insurance. I'm Shashank, your host and today we are back
[7.26 - 12.56]  with yet another amazing video for you. This is one of those videos that you've been waiting
[12.56 - 18.24]  for and have asked us time and again. Well, Axis Max Life Insurance has released one of
[18.24 - 24.40]  their newest plans. It's a term plan and it has tons of features in it. Now, to discuss
[24.40 - 29.28]  this in detail, I have with me in the studio, Sushant, who is our Senior Program Manager
[29.28 - 35.68]  here at Ditto. So, I'll hand over the whole stage to you, the whole studio to you, because
[35.68 - 41.76]  I would love for you to take us over through all the variants and all the features and
[41.76 - 46.64]  how different Axis Max Life is doing with this STPP plan.
[46.64 - 52.20]  Okay, Percy, thanks for having me once again. It's quite an interesting plan. For the rest
[52.20 - 58.00]  of this video, the plan's name is Smart Term Plan Plus, but we'll be calling it STPP for
[58.00 - 62.16]  your sake of convenience. But yes, I think the interesting bit here that they've done
[62.16 - 66.64]  is the number of variants that they have. They're pretty much trying to cater to any
[66.64 - 71.88]  and every kind of requirement you could possibly have. They're also thinking of any possible
[71.88 - 76.08]  scenario. They're thinking of plans where you have more focus on an accident cover and
[76.08 - 80.72]  less on your initial death benefit. They have cases where in the initial few years, your
[80.72 - 84.80]  cover amount is really high, but after that it reduces. They have a type of plan where
[84.80 - 88.96]  you get back your money in between, towards the end and so on. So, I'll try my best to
[88.96 - 93.68]  simplify it and cover all of them in a brief, structured sort of way. But with that, let's
[93.68 - 99.76]  get started. Before we begin though, just to let everyone know, earlier in the previous
[99.76 - 105.22]  variant, Max Life used to offer a 12% discount in the first year for salaried customers.
[105.22 - 110.52]  In this plan, they've made it a 15% discount for the first year, which is a plus. But from
[110.52 - 114.44]  the second year onwards, in comparison to the previous plan, there's an increase of
[114.44 - 119.72]  about 2% to 4%. So, Max Life is getting a bit more expensive. But nonetheless, like
[119.72 - 123.48]  I mentioned, the features that they're offering do make a compelling case for the premiums
[123.48 - 128.16]  that they're charging. Perfect. So, I think with that, let's get started. The first one
[128.16 - 133.48]  would be our primary recommendation, the most basic balanced cover plan. This is your regular
[133.48 - 138.24]  old-term plan, right? There's really not much to it. The minimum age to buy this plan is
[138.96 - 143.52]  18, the maximum is 60. Cover amounts of your choosing, I think it starts at about 50 lakhs
[143.52 - 148.72]  and can go up to at least 20-30 crores. They offer payment in years, like you have a single
[148.72 - 153.96]  pay option where you can pay all your premiums within one year, or you can pay a limited
[153.96 - 158.52]  pay just for 5-10 years or even a regular pay. So, like I mentioned, this is a pretty
[158.52 - 163.28]  basic term plan. So, at least this variant of it is the basic term plan. So, I don't
[163.28 - 166.72]  want to dwell on this too much. The next one, which is a bit interesting, is called the
[166.72 - 171.20]  rebalancing cover if I'm not wrong. So, this is the second variant. It's not something
[171.20 - 176.80]  I would actively recommend, but no harm in simplifying it. So, how this works is your
[176.80 - 184.36]  term plan will have a split of 10% and 90%, meaning 10% of basic death cover, 90% accident
[184.36 - 189.32]  death cover. So, what this means is if I buy a 2-crore plan, my cover amount will start
[189.32 - 193.96]  off with 20 lakhs of death benefit and 1.8 crores of accidental death benefit. And over
[194.00 - 199.12]  the span of my entire term insurance, my accident cover will get rebalanced, wherein it will
[199.12 - 204.52]  go all the way down to zero and my main death benefit will go all the way up to 2 crores.
[204.52 - 207.84]  This might be helpful, like if I were to think about, right, that who are they trying to
[207.84 - 213.20]  cater to for this? Maybe that sector of audience whose lifestyle or hobbies are such, or maybe
[213.20 - 216.80]  their job right now such that they travel a lot. They're a lot more prone to accidents
[216.80 - 221.28]  and that's maybe the current scenario. But over the span of 20-30 years, as their career
[221.28 - 226.36]  progresses, as life progresses, they're planning to cut that down and focus more on the actual
[226.36 - 231.20]  death cover as opposed to the accident part. So, like I said, not a very common use case,
[231.20 - 235.12]  not something I think a lot of people would be rushing to buy, but it's still interesting
[235.12 - 239.80]  for them to have come up with something like this. Another point to note for this particular
[239.80 - 245.16]  plan and why I maybe do like it a little bit is the fact that underwriting will only happen
[245.16 - 250.12]  for 50% of the sum in short. So, let's say if I as an individual cannot buy more than
[250.12 - 255.04]  1 crore of term insurance, through this plan I can buy 2 crores actually. I need to be
[255.04 - 258.88]  just eligible for one and they'll give me two. But with the caveat that look I start
[258.88 - 264.08]  off with 20 lakhs of credit, death benefit and towards the end I eventually become eligible
[264.08 - 267.80]  for 2 crores. So, like I said, it's got a mix of features.
[267.80 - 272.84]  Do you see people getting this plan more than the basic plan?
[272.84 - 275.64]  Not really, no. Very rare case scenario.
[275.64 - 279.04]  Alright, Sushant, before we head to the third variant, I'd like to tell our audience a little
[279.04 - 283.96]  about Ditto. So folks, Ditto is an insurance advisory platform where you can get free health
[283.96 - 289.12]  or term insurance advice from experts like Sushant himself. We are backed by Zerota and
[289.12 - 295.20]  we have over 10,000 plus reviews on Google with an average of over 4.9. So, if you want
[295.20 - 300.16]  to compare two policies or if you want to renew your old one or if you want to port,
[300.16 - 305.08]  then we can help you for free. You can get our expert guidance for free with a link in
[305.08 - 309.84]  the description. All you need to go is go to the link, fill in the details and we will
[309.84 - 315.56]  assign an IRDI certified advisor to you under two minutes. With that said, Sushant, let's
[315.56 - 316.56]  get back.
[316.56 - 321.96]  Cool, so I think the third variant now is something called early return of premium.
[321.96 - 327.08]  Now this as the name suggests, if it has return of premium in it, Ditto is very against it
[327.08 - 331.36]  and for pretty obvious reasons. I think return of premium plans are never worth it. If you
[331.36 - 337.68]  actually calculate the financial outflow, meaning my basic term plan cost me 20,000
[337.68 - 342.20]  but the return of premium plan would cost me at least 30-35,000. Now that additional
[342.20 - 345.80]  outflow, instead of giving it to the insurance company, if I were to go and invest it even
[345.80 - 350.08]  in something as simple as an FD, I would make a lot more money by the end of this tenure.
[350.08 - 353.76]  The insurance company is simply going to pay me back all my premiums and nothing else.
[353.76 - 357.48]  So yeah, early return of premium is a bit interesting in the sense they don't give it
[358.00 - 364.00]  at the end of it. What they do is they give you 50% of your premiums once you turn 60
[364.00 - 367.60]  and the remaining 50% at the end of the policy tenure. So maybe they're just trying to do
[367.60 - 372.00]  something a bit different from the traditional ROP but nonetheless, like I said, it's not
[372.00 - 376.72]  something we would ever recommend or ever suggest. It really doesn't make financial
[376.72 - 377.72]  sense.
[377.72 - 381.78]  Right, makes sense. So now let's head to the fourth variant.
[381.78 - 385.96]  This I think is probably one of my favorites in this plan and it's also Ditto's secondary
[385.96 - 390.24]  recommendation after the primary most basic plan. This is the one I would probably go
[390.24 - 395.44]  on as a second benefit. So this one is actually called Smart Cover and this is Ditto's secondary
[395.44 - 400.64]  recommendation after the primary one being a balanced regular term plan. And I did kind
[400.64 - 403.80]  of like this plan. I thought it was interesting what they've done here. So what MaxLife is
[403.80 - 408.32]  essentially done here is that they're offering a plan where for the first 15 years of your
[408.32 - 414.52]  term insurance, your sum insured is boosted by 50%. So let's say if I bought a 2 crore
[414.52 - 419.08]  term plan, for the first 15 years I will have a 3 crore term plan. And after that for
[419.08 - 422.08]  the rest of my tenure, it will come back down to 2 crores.
[422.08 - 426.52]  Okay, this is interesting. Why do you think they're giving us an accelerated, you know,
[426.52 - 427.64]  higher sum insured?
[427.64 - 432.44]  So this I think is for people who have financial responsibilities right now. For example, you've
[432.44 - 436.64]  got a home loan running, you've got an education loan running, but you also foresee that look,
[436.64 - 440.84]  15 years later I'm building my savings and investments parallelly. 15 years later I might
[440.84 - 446.08]  not need this much term insurance or I might not have that extra 1 crore of financial liability.
[446.08 - 449.64]  So it depends on profile to profile. But like I said, broadly these are the ones we've seen
[449.64 - 456.08]  where people who have liabilities or responsibilities upfront, to them maybe it makes sense. But
[456.08 - 462.00]  I think the interesting part here was in case I buy a 3 crore plan directly versus this plan,
[462.00 - 464.24]  I will save about 20% in premiums.
[464.24 - 471.28]  So there's a reason why it's Dito's recommendation. In your eyes, why do you think it is one of
[471.28 - 474.00]  the recommendations? Do you think people should consider this?
[474.00 - 477.60]  Look, like I said, it's our secondary recommendation. It's never going to be my primary. I would
[477.60 - 481.88]  always still rely on our level term insurance cover, which in fact, we even help you arrive
[481.88 - 486.12]  at how much you need, right? We look at inflation, we have an NPV calculator that we help you
[486.12 - 490.04]  decide how much insurance you should take. This being a secondary recommendation, because
[490.04 - 494.80]  look, it's specific for people who are one, if you're confident on your financial planning,
[494.80 - 498.88]  like I said, you're sure that 15 years later, you will have the savings and investments
[498.88 - 502.56]  that you thought you would, right? Wherein you're providing the family the safety net
[502.56 - 506.72]  through that as well. And two, you're also confident that in 15 years, your liabilities
[506.72 - 511.32]  will be taken care of. The additional responsibilities you have right now will not be there 15 to
[511.32 - 516.28]  20 years later. Because once you buy this, the plan is going to, I mean, this reduction
[516.32 - 520.04]  will happen by default. It's not something that you can later tap out of saying, hey,
[520.04 - 523.72]  actually, can you give me three crore for life? They can't do that. You've opted for
[523.72 - 530.04]  that variant. Yeah, like I said, it's a recommendation, but a secondary recommendation.
[530.04 - 536.48]  I think we've gotten four in our basket up until now. And I already see a variation of
[536.48 - 542.00]  a return of premium, the basic plan, the basic plan with little toppings. I mean, I don't
[542.00 - 546.28]  think that there is anything more that Axis Max Life could do. Or do you want to prove
[546.28 - 551.96]  me wrong? They have a bit. Look, the next couple of variants are variations of ROP.
[551.96 - 556.72]  So I think I can just cover those quickly. We don't really recommend those. So I'll just
[556.72 - 560.88]  go over them real quick. So the next one is actually a combination of a whole life and
[560.88 - 566.24]  an ROP plan. A whole life plan meaning you buy a term insurance till the age of 99 or
[566.24 - 569.92]  100. So this one's till the age of 100. Now, this isn't like your traditional whole life
[569.96 - 576.16]  plans offered by, let's say, ICICI, Protector. I think even Bajaj Itaq has this option. This
[576.16 - 580.08]  isn't like that. This comes with a mandatory ROP option as well. So in this plan, 50% of
[580.08 - 585.88]  your premiums are paid after you turn 60. And the remaining 50% is paid in case you
[585.88 - 591.12]  live out until 100. And if not, then should someone pass away, let's say at 70 or 75,
[591.12 - 595.76]  his family will get the claim amount and the remaining 50% of his premiums. They will pay
[595.76 - 599.64]  that back. So this, like I said, it's a bit complicated in terms of this combination of
[599.64 - 605.24]  whole life and ROP. As a concept, these are two variants that I again would never genuinely
[605.24 - 609.20]  advise to someone, considering the caveats that they come with, the additional premium
[609.20 - 613.72]  you pay and just as a concept, right? I mean, buying a life insurance for a whole life is
[613.72 - 618.12]  kind of like trying to buy money back plan. And an insurer is aware of this. So they're
[618.12 - 622.16]  going to charge you exorbitant premiums to make sure that they're not just handing out
[622.16 - 626.64]  two, three crores of claims. They'll collect that much premium over a span invested and
[626.64 - 631.56]  make sure they have the money ready for you. So rather than that, why not buy a traditional
[631.56 - 633.96]  term plan and do your own investments on the side?
[633.96 - 637.96]  Exactly. I think a lot of people are unaware about the fact that, you know, whole life
[637.96 - 643.84]  insurance is very different from term insurance. So folks, if you are one of them, and if you
[643.84 - 648.56]  end up buying or even considering an option, the first option, in fact, which comes on
[648.56 - 656.40]  your Instagram ad or even your Facebook wall, so maybe, maybe halt and pause and come over
[656.44 - 662.12]  to Rito's channel. We have made tons of videos where we've explained why a whole life insurance
[662.12 - 667.16]  plan might not be the best one for you. Well, in any case, if you want a direct call with
[667.16 - 672.92]  us, then the link in the description is always open for you. Book a free call with us. And
[672.92 - 677.56]  let me remind you, it's a free call and we will help you find the best term plan for
[677.56 - 682.08]  you so that you can protect your family and live life brindas.
[682.08 - 688.60]  Now, Sushant, let's go over the last two variants. I'm pretty, I mean, I don't know what I would
[688.60 - 690.60]  call it. I'm looking forward to it.
[690.60 - 696.96]  Right. So the sixth variant again is a traditional ROP variant, Plain and Simple Return of Premium.
[696.96 - 700.20]  Not like the previous where there's a whole life or there's an early return. This is just
[700.20 - 705.36]  traditional return of premium. Again, I think the premiums itself will speak for themselves.
[705.36 - 710.32]  Let's say for 30 year old male was buying a 3 crore plan for a span of 30 years, so
[710.32 - 716.36]  till his age of 60. Traditionally, his term insurance should cost him about 30,000, but
[716.36 - 721.48]  under this variant, his plan will cost him 90,000. So that's a 200% traditional outflow
[721.48 - 725.48]  in premiums. And our logic is the same, right? That additional outflow, we're assuming you
[725.48 - 729.40]  have the money to spend, right? If you're buying a plan like this, you do have the 90,000.
[729.40 - 733.96]  So why not pay the insurance company 30 and diversify the remaining 60? Put some in an
[733.96 - 739.68]  FD, some mutual funds, buy some gold for your kids, whatever, right? Sky's the limit. So
[739.68 - 744.12]  you could do whatever you'd like with that. Perfect. So needless to say, this is not one
[744.12 - 748.52]  of our recommendations. Cool. So the last variant is called the income protection option.
[748.52 - 754.00]  Now, this one is more for the nominees wherein when the claim happens, should someone pass
[754.00 - 758.44]  away and his family applies for the claim, the money will be dispersed in an income form.
[758.44 - 763.00]  It won't be given to them as a lump sum. Now, right off the bat, this feature is something
[763.00 - 767.68]  that, look, we personally don't actively recommend because we would rather the family get the
[767.68 - 772.84]  entire lump sum, right? Reason being that they have control over such a large amount
[772.84 - 776.72]  wherein should they have some immediate lump sum expenses coming up? Should there be a
[776.72 - 781.00]  loan that's running and they wish to just simply clear it off? Should there be major
[781.00 - 785.44]  expenses coming up like kids' education, marriage, and so on? You'd like to have that lump sum
[785.44 - 789.16]  with you to pay these off, right? And two, even if there's an emergency in the future
[789.16 - 793.28]  and you need to sort of pay things off, it does help to have control over that two crores
[794.28 - 798.04]  Nonetheless, insurance companies do try and make it as lucrative as possible for them
[798.04 - 802.68]  as well. Some people, in fact, prefer this thing that, look, I'm not sure if my family
[802.68 - 807.56]  will be financially sensible or responsible enough to handle such a large amount. Even
[807.56 - 811.16]  there, I think, are sort of counter to that is, you know, you can simply just open a fixed
[811.16 - 815.52]  deposit in the bank. You walk into a bank and say, hey, I have two crore and just watch
[815.52 - 820.36]  the line that comes to you, right? The line of employees that's after you. But nonetheless,
[820.44 - 825.00]  So what they've done firstly is a level income option, where plain and simple, over a span
[825.00 - 829.64]  of 10 years at least, you can choose the span as well, but 10 years is the bare minimum,
[829.64 - 834.08]  they will disperse this amount in monthly income format. So 120 installments if I choose
[834.08 - 837.40]  10 years, that's what my two crore, three crore will be divided into and the family
[837.40 - 842.32]  will receive this. So the second part under this is called the inflation proof income
[842.32 - 847.68]  cover. So what they've done here is every three years, the income that your family is
[847.68 - 853.68]  getting will increase by 10% to kind of maybe combat some form of inflation, right? Although
[853.68 - 858.92]  10% every three years, I don't think is even CPI index, right? It's less than that. But
[858.92 - 864.00]  nonetheless, every three years, 10% of income, the income amount will increase. And this
[864.00 - 868.66]  is capped at 200% of the original income. So if the duration you've chosen is such
[868.66 - 872.70]  that where it can keep increasing every three, three, three years, after eventually when
[872.70 - 877.40]  your income reaches 200%, it will stop increasing, they'll just get a level amount. And this
[878.04 - 882.84]  as many would guess, this variant is more expensive than the level income variant, because
[882.84 - 885.76]  they are essentially offering a higher payout to your family, right? More than what you
[885.76 - 890.24]  kind of purchase. So accordingly, the premiums as well would be a bit more expensive.
[890.24 - 891.24]  Right.
[891.24 - 895.52]  All in all, just to summarize, I think going over all seven features briefly, there are
[895.52 - 900.36]  about three of them which are ROP related. So let's just skip those. There's this one,
[900.36 - 905.56]  which is the income format that your family receives. The main three that I would say
[905.56 - 909.96]  is Ditto's primary recommendation, a balance cover. Ditto's secondary recommendation,
[909.96 - 913.40]  which is the boost one, where for the first 15 years, you have a higher sum insured and
[913.40 - 918.52]  then it reduces. And the third one being the balancing one between a regular and an accident,
[918.52 - 923.68]  1090, which reduces eventually. These are, I think, just to summarize, these are the
[923.68 - 925.56]  variants offered by Max in this plan.
[925.56 - 930.76]  Perfect. Perfect. So I was just thinking while you were explaining it to me, obviously, there
[930.76 - 936.48]  are a couple of riders that you can have which will make your term plan even much better.
[936.48 - 943.28]  But I was just thinking if there are any inbuilt benefits or features that these plans have
[943.28 - 947.72]  that would make people turn their eye towards the STP plan.
[947.72 - 951.36]  Yeah, there are quite a few free benefits actually. I think Maxlife has always been
[951.36 - 956.44]  known for that, where apart from the riders, they do tend to offer a bunch of inbuilt features
[956.44 - 960.12]  and inbuilt add-ons. And I think that's what really sets them apart, right? At the end
[960.12 - 962.56]  of the day, why they're as popular as they are.
[962.56 - 967.04]  So a couple of basic ones that are from the previous plan as well. I'll just quickly go
[967.04 - 971.64]  over those. You have your Terminal Illness Benefit. This is, I think, where you get a
[971.64 - 976.24]  payout of up to one crore on diagnosis of a terminal illness. And upon demise, if there
[976.24 - 979.56]  is an additional amount, the balance amount is paid to the family.
[979.56 - 983.88]  The Cover Continuance Benefit. This gives you an option to defer your premium payments
[983.88 - 988.24]  by 12 months. Should you, let's say, be between jobs in the future, right? And you feel, hey,
[988.24 - 992.28]  I don't want to take on this financial responsibility as well. You can simply tell them that, hey,
[992.28 - 995.04]  I'll pay you next year. Just let me be this year.
[995.04 - 996.04]  Khatme likhna.
[996.04 - 1000.60]  Yeah, exactly. So you do have to pay next year, of course. When you go back next year,
[1000.60 - 1004.68]  they will charge you double for the previous year and the current year. But it just offers
[1004.68 - 1009.96]  a bit of financial comfort to a person in a time of need. Then you have the Special
[1009.96 - 1014.40]  Exit Benefit, which is available after 30 years of policy completion and not in the
[1014.40 - 1020.00]  last four years. This, again, is a free of cost feature, right? Where whatever premiums
[1020.00 - 1024.36]  paid until then up to date, you'll get those back minus GST. So this is called Special
[1024.36 - 1028.88]  Exit or Early Exit, where should I wish to exit from my term plan earlier, not wait till
[1028.88 - 1032.68]  the completion? You can get back some money. And this is free of cost.
[1032.68 - 1037.00]  Another one that they've had from the previous variant is called the InstaClaim Payout, where
[1037.00 - 1040.88]  this is applicable after one year of policy completion. And they have different bands
[1040.88 - 1044.00]  for this, that if your covered amount is such, it's only so much. But just to give you a
[1044.00 - 1049.24]  rough perspective, in case someone's family applies for a claim, and it's been more than
[1049.24 - 1054.36]  a year since he purchased the plan, they will pay out a very small amount immediately that
[1054.36 - 1058.28]  day or the next day itself. And the balance amount will be processed after due process
[1058.28 - 1063.20]  and due diligence of the claims paperwork. This is a very normal amount, up to two lakhs
[1063.20 - 1067.32]  maximum. If your sum in short is lower, it could even be lower. Like I said, this is
[1067.32 - 1071.36]  the maximum that they offer. So nonetheless, this could help you with immediate expenses
[1071.44 - 1077.44]  that come up, maybe taking care of hospital bills in a time like that or anything at all.
[1077.44 - 1081.60]  So this does help out. So another one here is obviously the price difference between
[1081.60 - 1086.16]  male and female. Ideally how it was before in the insurance industry was that it was
[1086.16 - 1090.32]  never clearly defined as a percentage. This was a well-known fact that when you buy life
[1090.32 - 1095.24]  insurance of the same profile, male and female, same age, same everything, the prices were
[1095.24 - 1099.72]  different. Now by how much? Sometimes dependent on age and profile and everything. But often
[1099.76 - 1104.04]  a lot of brands have started standardizing the percentage. So it's now clear that it's
[1104.04 - 1109.88]  a 15% difference. If a male individual pays X amount, the female of the same age buying
[1109.88 - 1114.36]  everything else the same, she'll pay about 15% lesser. So that's an advantage that they
[1114.36 - 1118.40]  get because of mortality rates, plain and simple. A female's life expectancy is a lot
[1118.40 - 1123.60]  more than a male's. So accordingly, the risk for an insurance company is calculated accordingly.
[1123.60 - 1127.04]  Now there's a couple of free ones that again stood out to me and I thought they were unique
[1127.12 - 1132.12]  and I personally like them as well. So the first one is again related to female clients
[1132.12 - 1137.60]  specifically. It's called the Lifeline Plus Variant. So this one gives a female policy
[1137.60 - 1144.60]  holder the option to enhance her sum insured post her spouse's demise. Meaning in case
[1144.64 - 1149.92]  her spouse were to pass away. Ideally she does have more responsibilities on her now, right?
[1149.92 - 1154.92]  The kid is, you know, the kid's responsibilities, parents and laws, whatever it is. The financial
[1154.96 - 1160.24]  responsibilities do increase slightly. Therefore they give her the option to modify her existing
[1160.24 - 1165.64]  term plan itself and increase the cover amount by up to 50% or 50 lakh whichever is lower.
[1165.64 - 1170.32]  Now this can only be done after at least 3 years of holding the policy and 2 it has to
[1170.32 - 1174.80]  be done within 6 months to 2 years of the spouse's demise. So they will need proof
[1174.80 - 1177.80]  of this obviously and accordingly you can show them that hey this is the date it happened
[1177.80 - 1181.44]  and they'll give you this benefit. This is a well thought benefit. Exactly, I really
[1181.44 - 1186.24]  thought it was a thoughtful benefit. The last one now is again related to the special
[1186.24 - 1190.16]  exit benefit but this is specifically for customers who have chosen limited pay as their
[1190.16 - 1193.60]  payment option. Meaning you're not going to pay for the entire policy 10 years, you're
[1193.60 - 1198.38]  going to pay for just 5, 10, 15 years. Now what they've done is your regular special
[1198.38 - 1202.68]  exit plan where you exit the plan early at a predefined moment. You get back all your
[1202.68 - 1207.56]  premiums minus GST. Here again MaxLife has defined those moments. This might sound a
[1207.56 - 1211.60]  bit confusing but what they've essentially done is it's either at policy term minus
[1211.60 - 1217.16]  13 years meaning 13 years before your policy were to expire. So if it were to 70 at 57
[1217.16 - 1222.92]  is the benefit or its policy term minus 7 years. This depends profile to profile payment
[1222.92 - 1227.68]  and so on. So I think maybe for specific profiles that advisors can help. And the benefit here
[1227.68 - 1231.92]  is that you get 200% of your premiums. You don't just get back 100%. So let's say if
[1231.92 - 1236.84]  you paid them as total of about 5 lakhs you'll get back almost 10 lakhs. That's what you're
[1236.84 - 1240.44]  eligible for. Like I said the condition when you can get it, it's best you just get in
[1240.44 - 1244.88]  touch with our advisors and they'll probably guide you based on your profile. And to point
[1244.88 - 1248.88]  to note this is only available if you've chosen a limited pay. Which in fact is increasing
[1248.88 - 1252.68]  these days. We're seeing a trend where people are opting for limited pay more and more with
[1252.68 - 1256.04]  the logic that look the convenience factor of it. We just want to get this done within
[1256.04 - 1260.56]  5, 10 years. It's not about whether regular pay versus limited pay what makes more sense.
[1260.56 - 1264.90]  It's simply about not wanting to have such a long term financial commitment. So they're
[1264.90 - 1269.10]  okay with paying for 5, 10 years and wrapping this up, letting the policy continue and maybe
[1269.10 - 1273.82]  20, 30 years later Max Lef says hey would you like to exit and get back 200% of your
[1273.82 - 1277.94]  premiums. I mean who wouldn't want that? Exactly. It really might make sense to some profiles.
[1277.94 - 1281.78]  But yeah I think that summarizes the free features as well. Right those are some pretty
[1281.78 - 1287.58]  great in-bird features. Now I'm excited to see the paid add-ons. What do they look like?
[1287.58 - 1291.22]  Anything that stood out? So they have the traditional ones your waiver of premium, critical
[1291.22 - 1295.10]  illness, accidental death. So I'd rather not go into the specifics of those. I think we've
[1295.10 - 1300.14]  covered those a bunch of times. The one that stood out to me is again this has probably been
[1300.14 - 1306.46]  picked from like a health insurance plan. It's a maternity benefit. So again it's something specific
[1306.46 - 1314.50]  for female leads wherein you can claim up to 2 lakhs worth of maternity expenses. So here again
[1314.50 - 1319.14]  some conditions you have to be between 18 and 40 when you buy this plan. There's a 10 month
[1319.18 - 1323.30]  waiting period. So from the date of purchase of the plan you can exercise this benefit only after
[1323.30 - 1327.54]  10 months. That's when this benefit kicks in and this benefit is active only for the span of 5
[1327.54 - 1333.58]  years. The summer short that they're offering for this is 2 lakhs. Now this isn't bad I think in a
[1333.58 - 1338.18]  metro city like Bangalore, Delhi in most private hospitals I think maternity shouldn't cost more
[1338.18 - 1344.18]  than that 2-3 lakhs at most. And in fact in health insurance it's not a feature we recommend. We do
[1344.18 - 1348.54]  suggest that you rely on your corporate health insurance for this. And again I think we've done
[1348.54 - 1353.62]  a separate video on this too. But for someone to offer this within term insurance it's the first of
[1353.62 - 1359.94]  its kind and I do like this. Alright Sushant. Now I think this is the moment that everyone's
[1359.94 - 1366.86]  been waiting for. Pretty good variance, pretty good plan, pretty good riders that you have and
[1366.86 - 1373.50]  benefits all nailed. But how much is it going to cost us? So they're actually not bad. I think
[1373.50 - 1379.90]  Maxlife has always been known to offer competitive premiums with quite solid comprehensive features.
[1379.90 - 1385.06]  Now like I mentioned at the start of this video in comparison to the previous plan it might be 2 to 4
[1385.06 - 1391.26]  percent more expensive but they're still quite competitive. So let's take a 25 year old nonsmoker
[1391.26 - 1398.70]  male buying a 1 crore plan till the age of 65. A 1 crore plan would cost him about 10,000, a 2 crore
[1398.70 - 1399.54]  plan would cost him about 17,000 and a 3 crore would be about 25,000. Pretty good rates. The next profile for a slightly older individual, a 40 year old male buying it till 65. A 1 crore plan would cost him somewhere about 20,000, a 2 crore plan would be somewhere about 35,000 and a 3 crore is somewhere at about 52,000. So again not bad if you compare it to other insurers out there this is reasonable and quite competitive. So finally before we head towards the end of the video Sushant I want to ask you. You've
[1428.70 - 1458.46]  seen many term plans out there. What is your take on Max Life taking back their STEP plan and bringing in STPP? So do you think it's a step up or a step down? Definitely a step up I think because they've maintained some of the good features from STEP and they've brought in a host of new features as well. One thing I particularly liked was a couple of features specifically targeting the female audience. I thought that was quite interesting and thoughtful of them to do.
[1458.46 - 1470.22]  Additionally offering variants in terms of customization and so on. I thought that was comprehensive as well. The ROP variants of course maybe we're not the happiest with that but you can't be too happy.
[1470.22 - 1488.22]  Perfect. Thank you so much Sushant for joining us and folks you heard it from the expert himself. So STPP plan is really a good one in the market at the moment. So if you guys want to book a call with us to know more about STPP plan and if it's the right one for you,
[1488.22 - 1494.46]  then please book the call with us with the link in the description. I'll see you in the next one. Happy insurance hunting.
