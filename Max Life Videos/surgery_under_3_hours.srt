1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,160
 Your surgery gets done in 3 hours, no overnight stay, no hospital bed and yet the bill is

2
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:08,160
 50,000 rupees.

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,360
 You say, alright I'll file a claim.

4
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:14,660
 The insurer says, claim rejected, no 24 hour admission.

5
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:15,660
 Now what?

6
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:17,720
 That's where day care procedures come in.

7
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:24,800
 And today we're going to simplify this essential but misunderstood benefit in health insurance.

8
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:33,160
 Hey everyone, I'm Shashank from Ditto and in this episode of Health Insurance 101, we'll

9
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:37,760
 explain what day care procedures are, which treatments qualify and what you should check

10
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,000
 in your policy to avoid nasty surprises later.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,880
 And if you're unsure whether your plan covers these, you can always book a free call with

12
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:45,880

13
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,440
 No jargon, no spam.

14
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:48,440
 Just clear answers.

15
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:50,040
 The link is in the description.

16
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:51,640
 Now let's start with the basics.

17
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:56,200
 Traditionally, insurance claims were allowed only if you were hospitalised for more than

18
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,640
 24 hours.

19
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:02,520
 But thanks to medical tech, many surgeries and treatments today are completed in just

20
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,520
 a few hours.

21
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,040
 That's where day care procedures come in.

22
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:11,320
 These are treatments that would normally need hospitalisation but now can get done

23
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:14,840
 in less than 24 hours due to modern techniques.

24
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:18,760
 And yes, they are covered by most modern insurance plans.

25
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:19,760
 Examples?

26
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:25,600
 Cataract surgery, chemotherapy, dialysis, tonsil removal, hernia surgery, nearthroscopy

27
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,600
 and so on.

28
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:31,240
 Each insurer usually has a list of 100-600 plus such treatments.

29
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:36,040
 Some plans now even cover any medically necessary day care procedures, not just those on the

30
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,040
 list.

31
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:42,480
 But note, it must be done in a hospital or surgical centre only and not just at a doctor's

32
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,480
 clinic.

33
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:47,600
 You'll need discharge surgeries and procedures notes to file a claim.

34
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,880
 Day care vs OPD.

35
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,120
 Now what's the difference between them?

36
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:56,080
 If it's a short surgery under medical supervision in a hospital setup, it's called day care.

37
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:59,840
 If it's just a consultation or a basic scan, it's OPD.

38
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,720
 And OPD isn't usually covered unless you've taken as an add-on.

39
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:07,040
 So why is day care covered a must-have?

40
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,120
 Because modern healthcare is fast.

41
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:14,040
 Cataracts, chemo, kidney stone removal, all of these can cost 50,000 rupees or more per

42
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,680
 And you shouldn't lose a claim just because you didn't stay overnight.

43
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:22,800
 So if you're buying insurance for seniors or anyone with chronic conditions, day care

44
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,800
 covered is essential.

45
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,680
 Here's what you should check in in your policy.

46
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,660
 How many procedures are covered?

47
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:31,680
 Is it fixed list or an open-ended clause?

48
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,020
 Is cashless available for day care?

49
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:37,140
 Is there any waiting period for specific procedures?

50
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:42,200
 And final tip folks, never assume a treatment is day care or excluded.

51
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:48,120
 Ask your doctor for written documentation and check with your insurer or PPA in advance.

52
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:52,240
 And if you want help reading your policy or understanding your options, book a free call

53
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,240
 with Ditto.

54
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,360
 We'll make it easy.

55
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:58,560
 In the next episode, we'll talk about domiciliary hospitalisation when treatment happens at

56
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,960
 home but is still covered like regular hospitalisation.

57
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:05,880
 If this episode helped you, share it with someone who's planning surgery.

58
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:08,000
 Let's make India more insurance aware.

59
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:08,800
 Happy insurance hunting.
