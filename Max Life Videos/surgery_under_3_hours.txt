[0.00 - 3.52] Your surgery gets done in 3 hours.
[3.52 - 8.20] No overnight stay, no hospital bed and yet the bill is 50,000 rupees.
[8.20 - 10.36] You say, alright, I'll file a claim.
[10.36 - 12.68] The insurer says claim rejected.
[12.68 - 14.68] No 24 hour admission.
[14.68 - 15.68] Now what?
[15.68 - 17.96] That's where daycare procedures come in.
[17.96 - 22.72] And today we're going to simplify this essential but misunderstood benefit in health insurance.
[22.72 - 33.08] Hey everyone, I'm Shashank from Ditto and in this episode of Health Insurance 101, we'll
[33.08 - 37.88] explain what daycare procedures are, which treatment is qualified and what you should check in
[37.88 - 41.00] your policy to avoid nasty surprises later.
[41.00 - 44.88] And if you're unsure whether your plan covers these, you can always book a free call with
[44.88 - 45.88] Ditto.
[45.88 - 47.44] No jargon, no spam.
[47.44 - 50.04] Just clear answers, the link is in the description.
[50.04 - 51.72] Now let's start with the basics.
[51.72 - 56.24] Traditionally, insurance claims were allowed only if you were hospitalized for more than
[56.24 - 57.64] 24 hours.
[57.64 - 62.52] But thanks to medical tech, many surgeries and treatments today are completed in just
[62.52 - 63.52] a few hours.
[63.52 - 66.24] That's where daycare procedures come in.
[66.24 - 71.36] These are treatments that would normally need hospitalization but now can get done
[71.36 - 74.88] in less than 24 hours due to modern techniques.
[74.88 - 79.16] And yes, they are covered by most modern insurance plans.
[79.16 - 85.60] Cataract surgery, chemotherapy, dialysis, tonsil removal, hernia surgery, knee arthroscopy
[85.60 - 86.76] and so on.
[86.76 - 91.24] Each insurer usually has a list of 100 to 600 plus such treatments.
[91.24 - 96.72] Some plans now even cover any medical necessary daycare procedures, not just those on the list.
[96.72 - 102.04] But note, it must be done in a hospital or surgical centre only and not just at a doctor's
[102.04 - 103.04] clinic.
[103.04 - 107.60] You'll need the sharp surgeries and procedures notes to file a claim.
[107.60 - 108.60] Daycare vs. OPD.
[108.60 - 111.12] Now, what's the difference between them?
[111.12 - 116.08] If it's a short surgery under medical supervision in a hospital set up, it's called daycare.
[116.08 - 119.84] If it's just a consultation or a basic scan, it's OPD.
[119.84 - 123.72] And OPD isn't usually covered unless you've taken as an add-on.
[123.72 - 127.04] So why is daycare covered a must-have?
[127.04 - 129.28] Because modern health care is fast.
[129.28 - 134.12] Cataracts, chemo, kidney stone removal, all of these can cost 50,000 rupees or more per
[134.12 - 135.12] session.
[135.12 - 138.68] And you shouldn't lose a claim just because you didn't stay overnight.
[138.68 - 142.80] So if you're buying insurance for seniors or anyone with chronic conditions, daycare
[142.80 - 144.12] covered is essential.
[144.12 - 146.68] Here's what you should check in in your policy.
[146.68 - 148.68] How many procedures are covered?
[148.68 - 151.72] Is it fixed list or an open ended clause?
[151.72 - 154.04] Is cashless available for daycare?
[154.04 - 157.16] Is there any waiting period for specific procedures?
[157.16 - 162.52] And final tip folks, never assume a treatment is daycare or excluded.
[162.52 - 168.12] Ask your doctor for written documentation and check with your insurer or PPA in advance.
[168.12 - 172.24] And if you want help reading your policy or understanding your options, book a fee call
[172.24 - 173.24] with Ditto.
[173.24 - 174.36] We'll make it easy.
[174.36 - 179.08] In the next episode, we'll talk about domicileary hospitalization when treatment happens at home
[179.08 - 181.96] but is still covered like regular hospitalization.
[181.96 - 185.52] If this episode helped you, share it with someone who's planning surgery.
[185.52 - 188.04] Let's make India more insurer and so where?
[188.04 - 188.84] Happens char and sounding.
