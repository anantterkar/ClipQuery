1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,160
 Tata as a brand needs no introduction in India.

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:10,200
 Known for its trust, legacy and customer first approach, the group has built credibility across sectors,

3
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,280
 from automobiles to steel to telecom.

4
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:13,560
 But what about insurance?

5
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:17,680
 Is Tata AIG's health insurance actually worth your money in today's competitive market?

6
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,400
 That is what we'll break down in this video.

7
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:20,600
 Hello folks, I'm Shashank.

8
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:26,480
 You're watching Ditto Insurance and in this video, we'll take a detailed look into how Tata AIG performs as an insurer,

9
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:31,120
 how its plans stack in terms of features and value, and which of its five major products

10
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:35,860
 may or may not make sense for your needs. And if you're new here, let me tell you that Ditto is an

15
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,260
 Now, let's start with how Tata AIG performs as an insurer.

16
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:01,160
 In terms of CSR, Tata AIG averages around 96% over the past 3 years.

17
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:05,120
 That's quite impressive, better than ICICI Lombard and even close to HDFC Ergo.

18
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:09,360
 When we look at the complaints volume, they stand at about 11 complaints per 10,000 claims.

19
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:12,240
 Not the best, but still better than most public sector players.

20
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:15,420
 Their ICR or incurred claim ratio is around 81%,

21
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:18,360
 which means they're paying out a decent share of the premiums collected as claims.

22
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:22,200
 The network hospital strength is solid as well, over 11,000 hospitals,

23
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:26,620
 which is well within the expected range for a top insurer like Tata AIG.

24
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:33,500
 Now coming to the actual plans, Tata AIG currently offers 5 main health insurance plans under its Medicare branding.

25
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:35,500
 Let's break each one down one by one.

26
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,500
 First is Medicare, which is their standard offering.

27
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:52,410
 It a clean straightforward plan with decent coverage and minimal restrictions There are no room rent limits no disease sub no co clauses and pre and post are covered for 60 and 90 days and you get a restoration once a year although only after the first claim

28
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:55,010
 and for the same illness, there's a 45-day waiting period.

29
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:57,110
 The plan includes in-built consumables cover,

30
00:01:57,370 --> 00:01:59,810
 AYUSH and global cover for treatments diagnosed in India.

31
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:02,370
 Bonus is 50% per year capped at 100%.

32
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:05,050
 The health check-up is once every two claim-free years.

33
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:09,610
 At a premium of Rs. 12,300 for a 30-year-old adult, it's reasonably priced.

34
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:13,070
 Next is Medicare Lite and frankly, this one doesn't stand out.

35
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:18,030
 It feels like a stripped-down version of the Medicare, made to compete with cheaper options.

36
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:21,410
 While it does offer pre- and post-hospitalization coverage of 60 and 180 days

37
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:25,250
 and includes hearing aid coverage and annual checkups, it comes with major drawbacks.

38
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:28,030
 There's a copayment of 20% if you buy it after age 61

39
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:31,750
 and a 30% copayment if treated outside Tata's preferred hospital network.

40
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:35,710
 Restoration is limited to once per year and the no claim bonus drops after a claim.

41
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:43,610
 Premium for a 30-year-old is Rs. 10,000 which is lower but the trade-offs in flexibility and post-claim benefits may not justify the saving.

42
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:47,210
 Then comes Medicare Premium which is their most comprehensive retail plan.

43
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:54,650
 This one is designed for people who want benefits beyond traditional hospitalization like maternity, OPD, dental and high-end diagnostics.

44
00:02:54,650 --> 00:03:01,610
 It removes room and restrictions and disease-wise sub-limits and offers restoration global cover, inbuilt consumables and vaccination benefits as well.

45
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:06,010
 Maternity cover ranges from 50,000 to 1 lakh rupees depending on the sum insured and comes

46
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:08,790
 with child specific benefits if a girl child is born.

47
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:13,930
 OPD, dental and diagnostics are accessible after 2 years and scale up depending on your

48
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:14,930
 coverage level.

49
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:17,670
 It's clearly a high end plan and is priced accordingly.

50
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:23,770
 For a 30 year old, the premium is 14,100 rupees which is on the higher side but justifiable

51
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:37,100
 given the added features Before we head to the next plan let me remind you that Ditto services are totally free for you right from applications to claim support we are your insurance buddies book that free 30 minute call with the link in the description and start your stress insurance

52
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:41,640
 journey now let's talk about elder care which is a basic plan designed for senior citizens between

53
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:47,420
 the ages of 65 and 85 it offers some insured options from 5 to 25 lakhs but has several

54
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:52,380
 limitations there's a mandatory copay of 20 percent sublimits on surgeries no domiciliary

55
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:56,840
 coverage and no restoration benefit. Even the pre and post coverage is limited to 30 and 60 days

56
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:01,180
 and while there is an option to waive off the copay by paying extra, the plan still feels

57
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:05,220
 underwhelming. It's more of a fallback option for those who are struggling to find approval

58
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:11,900
 for other plans. For a senior couple aged 62, the premium can go as high as Rs. 83,000 for basic

59
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:16,820
 coverage. Lastly, there is Medicare Plus Super Top-Up, which is Tata's super top-up offer. It's

60
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:21,980
 a solid plan with deductibles starting from 2 to 20 lakhs and some insured options from 3 lakh to

61
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:26,640
 1 crore. No room rent limits, no co-payments and no sub-limits make it quite consumer friendly.

62
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:31,260
 It includes inbuilt consumables, annual checkups and AYUSH. This plan is meant for people who

63
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:36,120
 already have base insurance or are looking to build a layered cover affordably. It does its

64
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:40,540
 job well without any unreasonable exclusions. Now, let's break down the premium numbers.

65
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:46,520
 In Delhi, for a sum insured of 10 lakh rupees, a 30-year-old individual pays 12,300 for Medicare,

66
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:52,160
 10,000 rupees for Medicare Lite and 14,100 for Medicare Premier. For a couple aged 30,

67
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:59,400
 the costs are 19,700, 16,000 rupees and 22,000 respectively. A family of three with two 30-year-old

68
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:06,420
 adults and a five-year-old child pays 23,500 for Medicare, 19,200 for Lite and 27,300 for Premier.

69
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:18,609
 Now purely from a cost perspective the standard Medicare plan strikes a good balance between affordability and coverage Medicare Lite might appeal to budget buyers but its restrictive features weaken its long value

70
00:05:18,829 --> 00:05:24,329
 Medicare Premier is expensive but worthy if you truly need maternity, OPD, and other high-end benefits.

71
00:05:24,529 --> 00:05:28,069
 Eldercare should be looked at only if you have limited options elsewhere.

72
00:05:28,309 --> 00:05:31,969
 And the Super Top-Up plan is a good complement if you already have a base plan.

73
00:05:32,049 --> 00:05:35,729
 But even with all this, there's one important thing that you need to consider.

74
00:05:35,729 --> 00:05:41,769
 Tata AIG may win in trust and reliability as a brand and its plans are clean and well-priced.

75
00:05:41,889 --> 00:05:47,049
 But they don't push the envelope like other insurers in the market like HDFC Ergo,

76
00:05:47,429 --> 00:05:52,109
 Care Health, Niva Bupa and ICICI Lombard. Their offerings have better bonus structures,

77
00:05:52,549 --> 00:05:55,829
 better restoration terms and more innovative features through add-ons.

78
00:05:55,969 --> 00:06:00,989
 If you're looking for best class value, Tata may feel a little basic unless they upgrade

79
00:06:00,989 --> 00:06:03,489
 their plan variants and customization options.

80
00:06:03,489 --> 00:06:07,869
 So before you decide, here are 3 questions that you might need to ask yourself.

81
00:06:07,869 --> 00:06:08,869
 1.

82
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:12,369
 How much do you value brand trust vs cutting edge benefits?

83
00:06:12,369 --> 00:06:13,369
 2.

84
00:06:13,369 --> 00:06:17,449
 Do you need high end features like maternity or OPD or are you just looking for solid basic

85
00:06:17,449 --> 00:06:18,529
 hospitalization?

86
00:06:18,529 --> 00:06:19,529
 And 3.

87
00:06:19,529 --> 00:06:23,889
 Are you okay with going for simpler plan with fewer frills or do you want every rupee of

88
00:06:23,889 --> 00:06:26,689
 premiums to pack in most possible benefits?

89
00:06:26,689 --> 00:06:31,589
 If you're still confused about which plan to go with, Tata, AIG or any other, don't worry.
