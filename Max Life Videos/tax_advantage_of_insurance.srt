00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,800
 Hi folks, welcome to Ditto Insurance.

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:08,920
 This is one video that you should really not miss watching

3
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:10,680
 because after watching this video,

4
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:14,440
 you will know that you can claim reductions in your income tax

5
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:16,760
 if you have a health or a term insurance.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,920
 So to explain each and every bit of the ATC and the ATD deductions,

7
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:25,500
 I have with me the Senior Program Manager here at Ditto, Sushant.

8
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:26,480
 Welcome Sushant.

9
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:27,240
 Thanks Sushant.

10
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:32,900
 Sushant, I think we are living in a time where we are being taxed even for different flavors of popcorn.

11
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:42,660
 Though there have been a lot of memes floating around, you cannot ignore the fact that at the moment, we are being taxed the most in India.

12
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:50,060
 And anywhere where we can save money on our ID returns, I think we should grab a chance.

13
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:59,160
 So if the folks are watching this video have a health or term insurance, they do have the right to know that they can claim reductions on their IT interns.

14
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:04,540
 So let's start the video without any delay. So what do you have for us?

15
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:08,960
 I think we have a tax season around the corner. This is definitely a hot topic of discussion.

16
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:18,700
 And not only that, I think with the fact that we're a country with dual tax schemes or dual tax regimes, it's obviously confusing for a few people.

17
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:24,300
 firstly to understand how this even works and then to also get an idea on which one is more

18
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:29,700
 suited for them. So just to probably give them a rough just a rough overview before we go into it

19
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:36,120
 the old tax regime offers deductions as well but has higher tax slabs meaning the amount of tax

20
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:40,280
 or the percentages of tax I need to pay they pay that are higher but they have deductions wherein

21
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:51,116
 suppose my income for the year was 10 lakhs I can claim deductions for life insurance health insurance and various other things thereby bringing down my taxable income So that one aspect of it

22
00:01:51,176 --> 00:01:54,796
 which is the old regime. And the new regime doesn't offer any deductions whatsoever. And it

23
00:01:54,796 --> 00:02:00,016
 has lower slabs as well. So like I said, it really comes down to your specific profile and which one

24
00:02:00,016 --> 00:02:04,956
 would suit you better. But we'll of course today be discussing just the insurance specific aspects

25
00:02:04,956 --> 00:02:11,596
 of the reductions because obviously we're not you know CAs or CA certified sort of individuals here

26
00:02:11,596 --> 00:02:16,376
 so I think it's right it's best to stick to just the insurance part of it. Right so what do you

27
00:02:16,376 --> 00:02:20,516
 want to start with term or health? Let's do term first I think because that's a bit more simple and

28
00:02:20,516 --> 00:02:26,336
 straightforward. Okay. So any form of life insurance not just term insurance any form of life insurance

29
00:02:26,336 --> 00:02:33,636
 the premium that you pay can be claimed under section 80C of the Income Tax Act. Now 80C has

30
00:02:33,636 --> 00:02:41,216
 a limit of 1.5 lakhs per year. Now there's also a rule that came in that any policy purchased after

31
00:02:41,216 --> 00:02:50,296
 April 1st 2012, your premiums should not cross more than 10% of the sum insured for you to be

32
00:02:50,296 --> 00:02:55,176
 eligible for this. Now just to give you an example of what I mean by that, let's say if somebody has

33
00:02:55,176 --> 00:03:01,796
 a term insurance plan of 3 crore and his yearly premium is 50,000 rupees. This is well within 10%.

34
00:03:01,796 --> 00:03:06,956
 this rule comes in more for endowment plans or ULI plans the other forms of life insurance

35
00:03:06,956 --> 00:03:12,556
 wherein my sum insured itself is you know 10 lakhs and my premiums per year are one lakh change

36
00:03:12,556 --> 00:03:17,996
 because there's obviously investment and insurance combined into this right but here what essentially

37
00:03:17,996 --> 00:03:22,556
 would happen is my premium has crossed 10 percent of the sum insured 10 lakh plan the premium itself

38
00:03:22,556 --> 00:03:38,012
 1 lakhs um so that obviously wouldn be possible for me to claim under ATC it a very rare edge case situation but no harm in sort of just highlighting it Pure term insurance pure life insurance nothing to worry about It under if it within 1 lakhs

39
00:03:38,012 --> 00:03:38,752
 you can claim it here.

40
00:03:39,832 --> 00:03:40,912
 That's what it looks like, yeah.

41
00:03:41,172 --> 00:03:41,792
 All right, Sushant.

42
00:03:42,432 --> 00:03:45,732
 Now let's take a look at health insurance deductions.

43
00:03:46,552 --> 00:03:48,612
 Yes, so I think this has a separate section

44
00:03:48,612 --> 00:03:50,052
 just for itself.

45
00:03:50,872 --> 00:03:53,772
 It starts with foresee 25,000 as the limit.

46
00:03:54,012 --> 00:03:55,392
 This is section 80D.

47
00:03:56,232 --> 00:04:00,672
 So there's 25,000 as a limit if you're buying health insurance for yourself and your family.

48
00:04:01,472 --> 00:04:06,372
 Now, if you're buying health insurance for your parents as well, you have a separate 25,000 limit that you can claim for them.

49
00:04:07,232 --> 00:04:10,752
 It gets even better if your parents are above the age of 60.

50
00:04:10,752 --> 00:04:15,212
 If your parents are senior citizens, considering the fact that their premiums also shoot up,

51
00:04:15,712 --> 00:04:23,552
 the insurance companies and actually the government more than that has sort of acknowledged that since the premium you're paying is higher, the limit should be higher as well.

52
00:04:24,052 --> 00:04:25,852
 So now it's 25,000 for you and your family.

53
00:04:25,852 --> 00:04:29,392
 And if your parents are senior citizens, it's 50,000, not 25.

54
00:04:29,572 --> 00:04:31,992
 So you have a sum total of 75,000 that you can claim here.

55
00:04:32,952 --> 00:04:37,332
 Now, taking it one step further as well, if you yourself and your parents are senior citizens,

56
00:04:37,832 --> 00:04:41,272
 if an individual is, let's say, 60 and his parents are 80, mid-80s or so,

57
00:04:42,092 --> 00:04:46,212
 the limit goes up to 1 lakh now, considering that for both individuals combined,

58
00:04:46,292 --> 00:04:47,812
 the premiums would be quite exorbitant.

59
00:04:48,352 --> 00:04:51,772
 So they have given some flexibility and they've been considered with the age as well.

60
00:04:51,832 --> 00:04:53,792
 I think that that's one of the most important ones here.

61
00:04:53,792 --> 00:04:58,032
 Right, because unlike life insurance, health insurance premiums keep going up with age.

62
00:04:58,032 --> 00:05:05,632
 And they don't want a customer to feel that burden, but especially beyond 60, there's a chance you're not even working, you're not earning, but you're paying these high premiums.

63
00:05:05,632 --> 00:05:08,672
 So there should be some form of benefit that you're getting.

64
00:05:08,672 --> 00:05:22,228
 Additionally under ATD there another section called ATDD So this is for people with special disabilities So for is taking care of his family members who have special disabilities there a separate section

65
00:05:22,228 --> 00:05:26,148
 where you can claim expenses that you're sort of incurring to, you know, for their livelihood.

66
00:05:26,808 --> 00:05:32,448
 It's about 75,000 for normal disabilities and 1.25 lakhs for special disabilities.

67
00:05:33,328 --> 00:05:36,848
 So it's a separate section that they have to kind of take care of this as well.

68
00:05:36,848 --> 00:05:41,688
 All right, Shashank. Now, do our audience need to keep anything else in their mind?

69
00:05:41,848 --> 00:05:44,508
 Yes, there's a couple of pointers I would like to highlight.

70
00:05:44,808 --> 00:05:51,688
 One, always make your payments through digital modes, meaning a UPI, a debit or credit card or any sort of online payment.

71
00:05:52,308 --> 00:05:56,508
 You can't pay in cash is my point, because for those you won't be able to claim any deductions.

72
00:05:56,868 --> 00:05:58,508
 You have to show proof of payment.

73
00:05:58,708 --> 00:06:04,888
 This actually might be possible maybe through some offline agents, but most online channels where you purchase insurance, you won't have to worry about this.

74
00:06:05,728 --> 00:06:08,248
 Secondly, please make sure you have all your documentation in place.

75
00:06:08,248 --> 00:06:10,668
 so in order to actually claim these tax benefits

76
00:06:10,668 --> 00:06:13,068
 your CA will ask you to submit the premium receipts

77
00:06:13,068 --> 00:06:15,328
 that come with your insurance policy

78
00:06:15,328 --> 00:06:17,888
 the separate receipt that the insurance companies will share with you

79
00:06:17,888 --> 00:06:19,748
 which is used for tax purposes

80
00:06:19,748 --> 00:06:21,188
 it's in the correct format and everything

81
00:06:21,188 --> 00:06:23,488
 you just need to make sure you have that document ready

82
00:06:23,488 --> 00:06:25,328
 I think that's about it

83
00:06:25,328 --> 00:06:27,388
 there's really not much else to be mindful of

84
00:06:27,388 --> 00:06:29,628
 Alright Sushant, thank you so much for this

85
00:06:29,628 --> 00:06:31,508
 quick and short

86
00:06:31,508 --> 00:06:34,608
 I think explainer on how people can save on taxes

87
00:06:34,608 --> 00:06:36,448
 if they have health and term insurance

88
00:06:36,448 --> 00:06:42,248
 So folks, if you don't have a health or term insurance yet, then there is no better time than buying it now.
