[0.00 - 4.80]  Hi folks, welcome to Ditto Insurance.
[5.08 - 8.92]  This is one video that you should really not miss watching
[8.92 - 10.68]  because after watching this video,
[10.82 - 14.44]  you will know that you can claim reductions in your income tax
[14.44 - 16.76]  if you have a health or a term insurance.
[17.00 - 21.92]  So to explain each and every bit of the ATC and the ATD deductions,
[22.36 - 25.50]  I have with me the Senior Program Manager here at Ditto, Sushant.
[25.80 - 26.48]  Welcome Sushant.
[26.74 - 27.24]  Thanks Sushant.
[27.24 - 32.90]  Sushant, I think we are living in a time where we are being taxed even for different flavors of popcorn.
[33.16 - 42.66]  Though there have been a lot of memes floating around, you cannot ignore the fact that at the moment, we are being taxed the most in India.
[43.22 - 50.06]  And anywhere where we can save money on our ID returns, I think we should grab a chance.
[50.06 - 59.16]  So if the folks are watching this video have a health or term insurance, they do have the right to know that they can claim reductions on their IT interns.
[59.38 - 64.54]  So let's start the video without any delay. So what do you have for us?
[64.68 - 68.96]  I think we have a tax season around the corner. This is definitely a hot topic of discussion.
[69.72 - 78.70]  And not only that, I think with the fact that we're a country with dual tax schemes or dual tax regimes, it's obviously confusing for a few people.
[78.70 - 84.30]  firstly to understand how this even works and then to also get an idea on which one is more
[84.30 - 89.70]  suited for them. So just to probably give them a rough just a rough overview before we go into it
[89.70 - 96.12]  the old tax regime offers deductions as well but has higher tax slabs meaning the amount of tax
[96.12 - 100.28]  or the percentages of tax I need to pay they pay that are higher but they have deductions wherein
[100.28 - 111.12]  suppose my income for the year was 10 lakhs I can claim deductions for life insurance health insurance and various other things thereby bringing down my taxable income So that one aspect of it
[111.18 - 114.80]  which is the old regime. And the new regime doesn't offer any deductions whatsoever. And it
[114.80 - 120.02]  has lower slabs as well. So like I said, it really comes down to your specific profile and which one
[120.02 - 124.96]  would suit you better. But we'll of course today be discussing just the insurance specific aspects
[124.96 - 131.60]  of the reductions because obviously we're not you know CAs or CA certified sort of individuals here
[131.60 - 136.38]  so I think it's right it's best to stick to just the insurance part of it. Right so what do you
[136.38 - 140.52]  want to start with term or health? Let's do term first I think because that's a bit more simple and
[140.52 - 146.34]  straightforward. Okay. So any form of life insurance not just term insurance any form of life insurance
[146.34 - 153.64]  the premium that you pay can be claimed under section 80C of the Income Tax Act. Now 80C has
[153.64 - 161.22]  a limit of 1.5 lakhs per year. Now there's also a rule that came in that any policy purchased after
[161.22 - 170.30]  April 1st 2012, your premiums should not cross more than 10% of the sum insured for you to be
[170.30 - 175.18]  eligible for this. Now just to give you an example of what I mean by that, let's say if somebody has
[175.18 - 181.80]  a term insurance plan of 3 crore and his yearly premium is 50,000 rupees. This is well within 10%.
[181.80 - 186.96]  this rule comes in more for endowment plans or ULI plans the other forms of life insurance
[186.96 - 192.56]  wherein my sum insured itself is you know 10 lakhs and my premiums per year are one lakh change
[192.56 - 198.00]  because there's obviously investment and insurance combined into this right but here what essentially
[198.00 - 202.56]  would happen is my premium has crossed 10 percent of the sum insured 10 lakh plan the premium itself
[202.56 - 218.01]  1 lakhs um so that obviously wouldn be possible for me to claim under ATC it a very rare edge case situation but no harm in sort of just highlighting it Pure term insurance pure life insurance nothing to worry about It under if it within 1 lakhs
[218.01 - 218.75]  you can claim it here.
[219.83 - 220.91]  That's what it looks like, yeah.
[221.17 - 221.79]  All right, Sushant.
[222.43 - 225.73]  Now let's take a look at health insurance deductions.
[226.55 - 228.61]  Yes, so I think this has a separate section
[228.61 - 230.05]  just for itself.
[230.87 - 233.77]  It starts with foresee 25,000 as the limit.
[234.01 - 235.39]  This is section 80D.
[236.23 - 240.67]  So there's 25,000 as a limit if you're buying health insurance for yourself and your family.
[241.47 - 246.37]  Now, if you're buying health insurance for your parents as well, you have a separate 25,000 limit that you can claim for them.
[247.23 - 250.75]  It gets even better if your parents are above the age of 60.
[250.75 - 255.21]  If your parents are senior citizens, considering the fact that their premiums also shoot up,
[255.71 - 263.55]  the insurance companies and actually the government more than that has sort of acknowledged that since the premium you're paying is higher, the limit should be higher as well.
[264.05 - 265.85]  So now it's 25,000 for you and your family.
[265.85 - 269.39]  And if your parents are senior citizens, it's 50,000, not 25.
[269.57 - 271.99]  So you have a sum total of 75,000 that you can claim here.
[272.95 - 277.33]  Now, taking it one step further as well, if you yourself and your parents are senior citizens,
[277.83 - 281.27]  if an individual is, let's say, 60 and his parents are 80, mid-80s or so,
[282.09 - 286.21]  the limit goes up to 1 lakh now, considering that for both individuals combined,
[286.29 - 287.81]  the premiums would be quite exorbitant.
[288.35 - 291.77]  So they have given some flexibility and they've been considered with the age as well.
[291.83 - 293.79]  I think that that's one of the most important ones here.
[293.79 - 298.03]  Right, because unlike life insurance, health insurance premiums keep going up with age.
[298.03 - 305.63]  And they don't want a customer to feel that burden, but especially beyond 60, there's a chance you're not even working, you're not earning, but you're paying these high premiums.
[305.63 - 308.67]  So there should be some form of benefit that you're getting.
[308.67 - 322.23]  Additionally under ATD there another section called ATDD So this is for people with special disabilities So for is taking care of his family members who have special disabilities there a separate section
[322.23 - 326.15]  where you can claim expenses that you're sort of incurring to, you know, for their livelihood.
[326.81 - 332.45]  It's about 75,000 for normal disabilities and 1.25 lakhs for special disabilities.
[333.33 - 336.85]  So it's a separate section that they have to kind of take care of this as well.
[336.85 - 341.69]  All right, Shashank. Now, do our audience need to keep anything else in their mind?
[341.85 - 344.51]  Yes, there's a couple of pointers I would like to highlight.
[344.81 - 351.69]  One, always make your payments through digital modes, meaning a UPI, a debit or credit card or any sort of online payment.
[352.31 - 356.51]  You can't pay in cash is my point, because for those you won't be able to claim any deductions.
[356.87 - 358.51]  You have to show proof of payment.
[358.71 - 364.89]  This actually might be possible maybe through some offline agents, but most online channels where you purchase insurance, you won't have to worry about this.
[365.73 - 368.25]  Secondly, please make sure you have all your documentation in place.
[368.25 - 370.67]  so in order to actually claim these tax benefits
[370.67 - 373.07]  your CA will ask you to submit the premium receipts
[373.07 - 375.33]  that come with your insurance policy
[375.33 - 377.89]  the separate receipt that the insurance companies will share with you
[377.89 - 379.75]  which is used for tax purposes
[379.75 - 381.19]  it's in the correct format and everything
[381.19 - 383.49]  you just need to make sure you have that document ready
[383.49 - 385.33]  I think that's about it
[385.33 - 387.39]  there's really not much else to be mindful of
[387.39 - 389.63]  Alright Sushant, thank you so much for this
[389.63 - 391.51]  quick and short
[391.51 - 394.61]  I think explainer on how people can save on taxes
[394.61 - 396.45]  if they have health and term insurance
[396.45 - 402.25]  So folks, if you don't have a health or term insurance yet, then there is no better time than buying it now.
