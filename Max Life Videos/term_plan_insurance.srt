1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,720
 You've heard of term plans, you've heard of return of premium plans, but what if I told

2
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:10,220
 you there's a version where you get all your money back and you don't have to pay extra

3
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:11,220
 for it?

4
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:13,840
 Yes, that's the promise of a zero-cost term plan.

5
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:15,880
 Sounds too good to be true, right?

6
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:16,880
 Let's break it down.

 No spam, no upselling, just clear personalized advice.

13
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:39,840
 What is zero-cost term plan?

14
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:45,040
 At its core, a zero-cost term plan is just a regular term insurance policy,

15
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,620
 but with one extra feature.

16
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:47,640
 And what is that?

17
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:49,540
 You get an optional exit window.

18
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:50,860
 Okay, now what does that mean?

19
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,320
 This means at a certain point in the future,

20
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,340
 say after 25 years or when you turn 60,

21
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:00,440
 you can exit the policy and get your base premiums refunded.

22
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:03,460
 No bonus, no interest, just the premiums you paid,

23
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,800
 minus taxes and rider charges.

24
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:06,380
 That's it.

25
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:10,180
 If you don't exit, it functions exactly like a regular term plan.

26
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,420
 It gives you the life cover till the end.

27
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,000
 No refund at maturity though.

28
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:18,040
 So essentially, zero cost is equal to regular term plan,

29
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:21,260
 plus exit option, plus refund on exit.

30
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:25,080
 It's called zero cost because if you exit and get back your premiums,

31
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,160
 your net cost becomes close to zero.

32
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:29,640
 Assuming of course, there's no death claim before that.

33
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,640
 Now, let's look at how this works.

34
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,760
 Say you're 30.

35
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:35,400
 You buy a 40-year term plan with 1 crore cover.

36
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,800
 You pay 20,000 rupees a year as premium.

37
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:40,280
 At 55 age, you paid for 25 years.

38
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:43,480
 Your kids are working, loans are done, you don't need life cover anymore.

39
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,200
 You're sorted.

40
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,360
 So, you decide to exit the term plan.

41
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:50,840
 And now the insurer refunds 5 lakh rupees, roughly the base premium you paid.

42
00:01:50,840 --> 00:02:03,080
 The life cover stops but you also stop paying Simple right Now you might be wondering Shashank what is the catch here And that where we come in Let go deeper See you actually don get a full refund

43
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:08,100
 The amount refunded doesn't include GST, which is around 18%,

44
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:13,000
 and it doesn't include rider costs, and doesn't include any growth or interest.

45
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:16,500
 So, if you're hoping for a bonus, there isn't one.

46
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:18,540
 Also, inflation hits real hard.

47
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:24,900
 A 10 lakh refund after 25 years might only be worth 3-4 lakh in today's money or even lesser.

48
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:30,700
 So while you do get your money back, it doesn't feel like much when you factor in the concept of time.

49
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,480
 But compared to return of premium plans, this is still way better because

50
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:38,840
 ROP plans charge 70-100% higher premiums for that refund.

51
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:42,360
 Zero cost term plans, they usually have similar pricing to normal term plans

52
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:45,580
 as long as you don't stretch your policy unnecessarily.

53
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:47,840
 Now here's something most people miss.

54
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:52,400
 To qualify for the refund, you sometimes need to take a longer policy term.

55
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:57,200
 Now, let's say you only need life cover till 65, which is also what we recommend at Ditto.

56
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:03,800
 But the insurer says you can only exit and get a refund if your policy goes till 75 or 80 years.

57
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:09,780
 Now, you're buying 10 to 15 extra years of cover you don't actually need just to get that refund,

58
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,900
 which means you pay more premiums, you're overinsured,

59
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:16,960
 and you take on risk of staying in longer than necessary.

60
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:22,080
 So yes, zero cost is better than ROP, but it still needs smart planning.

61
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:26,760
 And by the way, if you want help figuring out what term duration actually suits your life goals,

62
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:29,980
 not what the insurer says you should pick, book a free call with Ditto.

63
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:31,220
 The link is in the description.

64
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:33,820
 Now, a question we get asked all the time.

65
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:36,040
 Why would insurers even offer this feature?

66
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:37,460
 Won't it be a loss for them?

67
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:40,320
 Well, the answer is it works in their favor too.

68
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:41,240
 I'll tell you how.

69
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:43,580
 For starters, it makes term plans more attractive.

70
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:57,700
 The number one reason people hesitate to buy term insurance is because what if I survive and get nothing back This refund feature eases that concern More sales for them It also improves policy persistency and when you know you get a refund someday

71
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:01,040
 you're more likely to keep paying premiums year after year

72
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,700
 and that's great for the insurer.

73
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,120
 And here's the biggest one.

74
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,040
 Risk reduction.

75
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,580
 If you exit the plan after 25-30 years,

76
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,900
 you're doing it before the riskiest phase

77
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:13,820
 that is 860 and beyond when most death claims happen.

78
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:16,200
 So the insurer refunds your premium

79
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,920
 and quietly walks away from the high risk years.

80
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,360
 For them, it's a good trade.

81
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,140
 For you, it's a psychological win.

82
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,240
 Okay, now let's compare this with the return of premium plans.

83
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,320
 Everyone keeps asking us to compare them.

84
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:30,060
 Now, ROP plans charge nearly double the premiums

85
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:31,640
 and you have no exit flexibility.

86
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:35,100
 And you only get your money back if you survive the full term.

87
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,660
 No chance to walk away earlier.

88
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:39,000
 Zero cost term plans, on the other hand, give you an out.

89
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:41,540
 You can exit early, take a refund and be done.

90
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:44,220
 Both return only base premiums.

91
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:45,860
 No interest, no growth.

92
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:49,220
 but at least zero cost doesn't overcharge you from day one.

93
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:51,620
 Now, who should consider a zero cost term plan?

94
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,360
 Listen to this because this is important.

95
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:58,240
 It works best for young earners, say people in their 20s and early 30s,

96
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:02,040
 people expecting to retire early or don't want to commit till age 80,

97
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,580
 those who don't like the idea of losing money if they survive,

98
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:11,120
 and people with evolving financial goals and say you're unsure if you'll need cover beyond 60.

99
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,820
 Now this, it gives you flexibility.

100
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:14,440
 And what does Ditto recommend?

101
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:20,320
 We actually like zero-cost term plans not because they're revolutionary, but because they strike a good balance.

102
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:25,140
 Most comprehensive term plans today already include this exit option as a built-in feature.

103
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,980
 You're not even paying extra for it.

104
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,300
 But here's the catch.

105
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:31,580
 Don't stretch your policy artificially just to get the refund.

106
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:36,840
 If your insurance need ends at 65, don't buy a plan till 85 just to be eligible for that exit.

107
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:38,360
 That defeats the whole purpose.

108
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:53,919
 And finally when you reach that exit window say after 25 years you don have to exit Let say you 55 kids are grown loans are cleared but you still want the cover just in case Guess what Your premiums they stay the same It was fixed years ago That

109
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:58,179
 the beauty of term plan. So even if the 1 crore summer short has lost value due to inflation,

110
00:05:58,419 --> 00:06:02,939
 it's still a solid cover and you've already paid most of your premiums. At this point,

111
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:08,059
 exiting might not be worth it and that's okay too. You have the choice. And by the way,

112
00:06:08,099 --> 00:06:12,359
 if you want to check whether your current plan has this exit option or whether switching to a

113
00:06:12,359 --> 00:06:16,859
 zero-cost plan makes sense for your age and goals, book a free call with Ditto. It's free,

114
00:06:17,079 --> 00:06:20,979
 it's spam-free, and it could save you lakhs of rupees. You will find the link in the description.

115
00:06:21,239 --> 00:06:26,139
 Before we wrap up, here's a quick list of insurers offering zero-cost or smart exit features.

116
00:06:26,459 --> 00:06:31,619
 HTC Life's Click2Protect Super, Elite Plus, and Ultimate. ICICI Prudential iProtect Smart and

117
00:06:31,619 --> 00:06:37,859
 Super. Axis MaxLife STPP, that is Smart Term Plan Plus. Bajaj Alliance, eTouch2, and iSecure2.

118
00:06:37,999 --> 00:06:42,259
 Just make sure to check the exit window, eligibility conditions, and refund rules in each case.

119
00:06:42,359 --> 00:06:43,959
 These differ across insurers.

120
00:06:43,959 --> 00:06:45,279
 Oh, and one last thing,

121
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:48,599
 you might have heard about some plans offering 2x refund at the exit.

122
00:06:48,599 --> 00:06:51,199
 Yeah, that existed, but very briefly.

123
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:55,159
 ICICI, Bajaj and AccessMax Life were offering double the premiums

124
00:06:55,159 --> 00:06:57,399
 you paid for if you opted for limited pay.

125
00:06:57,399 --> 00:06:59,999
 But IRDI stepped in and said, hold up,

126
00:06:59,999 --> 00:07:03,159
 you can't refund more than 100% in a term plan.

127
00:07:03,159 --> 00:07:06,919
 So these plans are now being rolled back for some new buyers.

128
00:07:06,919 --> 00:07:10,559
 But if you already bought it, don't worry, your benefits are still valid.

129
00:07:10,559 --> 00:07:11,919
 That's the full picture, folks.

130
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:15,039
 Zero cost term plans aren't magic, but they're a smart middle path.

131
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:17,999
 You get solid cover, flexibility to walk away midway,

132
00:07:17,999 --> 00:07:20,559
 and none of the overcharging that comes with return of premium.

133
00:07:20,559 --> 00:07:23,119
 This don't fall for the marketing line blindly.

134
00:07:23,119 --> 00:07:25,759
 Understand how the exit works, when it works,

135
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:28,479
 and whether it makes sense for you to actually use it.

136
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:31,919
 And if you need help figuring this all out, you know where to go.

137
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:34,879
 Book a call with Ditto. Free advice, real advice.

138
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:36,399

139
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:39,039
 Thanks for watching folks. I'll see you in the next one.

140
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:41,039
 Until then, happy challenge hunting!
