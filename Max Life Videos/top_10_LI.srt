1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,100
 All right, let's start with a simple but really important question.

2
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:11,300
 What's the difference between term insurance and a life insurance?

3
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:16,320
 Because honestly, a lot of people still get confused between the two and it's totally normal.

4
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:17,660
 So here's the thing.

5
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,680
 Life insurance is this massive umbrella.

6
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:23,920
 Under this, you have different kinds of plans like endowment plans, money back plans,

7
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:27,760
 ULIPs, whole life policies, and of course, term insurance.

8
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,440
 Most traditional life insurance plans combine insurance and investment

9
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:35,620
 and they'll promise you returns, bonus additions, maturity amounts.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,100
 It all sounds nice but the reality is that these plans are usually expensive,

11
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:44,860
 complicated and honestly not the best if you purely want protection for your family.

12
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,680
 Now, term insurance is refreshingly simple.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,900
 You pay a small premium and in return, the insurer promises a big payout to your family

14
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:56,080
 if something happens to you during the policy term.

15
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:57,720
 No returns, no gimmicks.

16
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,360
 Just pure life cover.

17
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:04,340
 This is also why term insurance is super affordable compared to traditional life insurance products.

18
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:10,980
 And at Ritto, we focus only on term insurance and we don't sell whole life insurance policies or investment-based insurance products.

19
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:14,460
 We believe insurance should be for protection, not for saving or investing.

20
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:18,220
 And if you're even remotely thinking about getting a proper term insurance plan,

21
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:23,400
 you know, one that actually protects your family and fits your needs without all the unnecessary jazz,

22
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:25,280
 definitely book a free call with our advisors.

23
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:30,220
 We'll help you understand everything without any spam and the best part, our services are

24
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:31,280
 completely free.

25
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,280
 The link's in the description.

26
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,040
 Now that we're clear on that, let's dive into today's topic.

27
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,520
 We're going to talk about some of the biggest and most trusted life insurance companies

28
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:43,200
 in India, specifically the ones that are doing a fantastic job when it comes to term insurance.

29
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,500
 Quick point though, this is not a ranking.

30
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:48,900
 I'm not here to tell you which company is number one or number five.

31
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:51,280
 Each insurer has its own strengths and quirks.

32
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,780
 Your ideal insurer will depend on your personal needs.

33
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:58,580
 Alright, so let's start with the first giant, LIC, the Life Insurance Corporation of India.

34
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:04,460
 LIC's numbers are absolutely massive, an average CSR of 98.55% over the last 3 years,

35
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:12,060
 an amount settlement ratio of 95.5% and a total annual business of around 2.17 lakh crore rupees.

36
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:13,720
 Insane scale, let me tell you that.

37
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:20,080
 They also have a pretty solid 30-day claim settlement rate at 95.9%, which is decent, but not the fastest.

38
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:25,860
 Their solvency ratio is 1 to 9, basically meaning they have enough financial buffers to settle claims without stress.

39
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:30,920
 Now, LIC was founded way back in 1956 and it's basically the OG of the Indian insurance world.

40
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:35,060
 Even today, they dominate the market, especially in smaller towns and rural areas.

41
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:40,040
 They're government-backed and about 96.5% of the company is still held by the government of India,

42
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,640
 even after their historic IPO in 2022.

43
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:47,260
 When it comes to term plans, LIC offers the New Tech Term and the Digiterm Plan.

44
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:52,320
 But here's the thing, while LIC is super trustworthy, their term plans are not the cheapest.

45
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:56,700
 You'll find premiums slightly on the higher side and they're not exactly packed with features like

46
00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:01,920
 waiver of premium riders or critical illness add-ons that private insurers offer more aggressively.

47
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:08,120
 But if brand trust and rock-solid stability are your number one priority, LIC is a good option.

48
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:11,200
 Next up, let's talk about SBI Life Insurance.

49
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:23,421
 Again massive scale here they have an average CSR of 97 and an ASR of 95 SBI Life is actually a joint venture between State Bank of India and BNP Paribas Cardiff

50
00:03:23,581 --> 00:03:27,721
 And thanks to SBI's massive banking network, they've got distribution lockdown tight.

51
00:03:27,901 --> 00:03:31,321
 You will find SBI Life products being sold across thousands of branches,

52
00:03:31,701 --> 00:03:33,181
 even in the remotest parts of India.

53
00:03:33,181 --> 00:03:37,381
 Their premiums are usually quite reasonable and their solvency ratio stands at 2.1,

54
00:03:37,701 --> 00:03:38,521
 which is healthy.

55
00:03:38,521 --> 00:03:42,441
 The only slight hiccup? They don't offer super flashy term plan variants.

56
00:03:42,621 --> 00:03:46,441
 You get basic coverage, solid service, but slightly fewer customization options

57
00:03:46,441 --> 00:03:47,701
 compared to some other players.

58
00:03:47,921 --> 00:03:50,881
 Their key term plans are SBI Life eShield and SmartShield.

59
00:03:51,081 --> 00:03:54,941
 And if you're wondering whether you should pick based purely on premiums or company size,

60
00:03:55,101 --> 00:03:59,581
 quick reminder folks, at Ditto, we actually help you compare all these subtle differences for free.

61
00:04:00,001 --> 00:04:02,601
 We're not pushing products, we genuinely want you to get it right.

62
00:04:02,941 --> 00:04:05,861
 Again, the link's in the description if you want to chat or call.

63
00:04:05,861 --> 00:04:11,981
 Now, coming to HDFC Life Insurance, a favorite among salaried professionals and for a good reason.

64
00:04:12,201 --> 00:04:20,141
 Their CSR is brilliant, 99.2% and they settle most claims within 30 days and 98.9% of the time.

65
00:04:20,341 --> 00:04:25,501
 Almost flawless because they have a very strong solvency ratio too and barely any complaints registered.

66
00:04:25,741 --> 00:04:30,721
 HDFC Life has built its reputation on superior service, quality and minimal documentation hassles.

67
00:04:30,921 --> 00:04:34,721
 They're a tech-savvy company too, right from online onboarding to paperless servicing.

68
00:04:34,721 --> 00:04:37,261
 HDFC Life has been through some big changes recently.

69
00:04:37,661 --> 00:04:41,521
 They acquired Exide Life and now they're closely tied up with HDFC Bank

70
00:04:41,521 --> 00:04:44,421
 after the HDFC Limited and HDFC Bank merger.

71
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:48,841
 Their flagship term plans are Click2Pretect Super, Elite Plus and Ultimate.

72
00:04:49,241 --> 00:04:52,841
 Premiums are slightly on the higher side compared to a few other private players,

73
00:04:52,981 --> 00:04:56,901
 but the features, riders and flexibility, these are all top-notch.

74
00:04:57,121 --> 00:04:59,321
 Let's move to ICICI Prudential Life Insurance.

75
00:04:59,561 --> 00:05:01,161
 Solid, well-respected brand.

76
00:05:01,161 --> 00:05:05,081
 Their claim settlement ratio is 97.52%, very good,

77
00:05:05,241 --> 00:05:08,941
 but a little more complaint volume compared to HDFC or SBI Life.

78
00:05:09,061 --> 00:05:12,181
 And they manage a gigantic 3.1 trillion rupees in assets.

79
00:05:12,481 --> 00:05:14,041
 That's serious money muscle right there.

80
00:05:14,201 --> 00:05:17,041
 Their standout term plans are iProtect Smart and iProtect Super.

81
00:05:17,501 --> 00:05:18,981
 You'll find features like critical insider,

82
00:05:19,221 --> 00:05:21,821
 waiver of premium options, and even accidental death benefits.

83
00:05:22,081 --> 00:05:23,461
 Premiums are fairly competitive,

84
00:05:23,741 --> 00:05:28,001
 though some users have mentioned that their service responsiveness could improve slightly.

85
00:05:28,181 --> 00:05:30,501
 And remember, don't get lost in percentages alone.

86
00:05:30,501 --> 00:05:34,341
 At Ditto, when we help you pick your insurer, we look beyond just claim ratios.

87
00:05:34,701 --> 00:05:38,281
 We also see how many claims get settled quickly and how fast they respond to queries

88
00:05:38,281 --> 00:05:40,641
 and even tiny things like complaint volumes.

89
00:05:40,981 --> 00:05:44,121
 Alright, moving on, Bajaj Alliance Life Insurance.

90
00:05:44,421 --> 00:05:48,101
 Bajaj Alliance Life has been around since 2001 and for the longest time,

91
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:52,241
 it was a joint venture between Bajaj Finserv from India and Alliance SE from Germany,

92
00:05:52,441 --> 00:05:54,061
 one of the biggest insurance groups globally.

93
00:05:54,221 --> 00:05:57,661
 In 2025, Alliance SE decided to exit India completely

94
00:05:57,661 --> 00:06:03,561
 and Bajaj Finsaf bought out their 26% stake for a whopping 24,180 crore rupees.

95
00:06:03,741 --> 00:06:08,461
 So now, Bajaj Alliance Life is a 100% Indian-owned company under Bajaj Finsaf.

96
00:06:08,621 --> 00:06:10,681
 Metrics-wise, it's solid across the board.

97
00:06:10,821 --> 00:06:14,341
 Claim settlement ratio sits at a high 99.11%.

98
00:06:14,341 --> 00:06:18,541
 ASR is 93.5%, slightly lower than some others, but still healthy.

99
00:06:18,741 --> 00:06:22,701
 Their solvency ratio is a whopping 5.1, the highest among all major insurers.

100
00:06:23,021 --> 00:06:24,781
 Now, what this means for you is simple.

101
00:06:24,781 --> 00:06:39,743
 Even in a worst economic crash scenario Bajaj Alliance would be among the last to feel liquidity pressure That a good sign for long security Their term plans the eTouch 2 and iSecure 2 are pretty future You get options for critical illness cover accidental debt benefit

102
00:06:40,143 --> 00:06:42,623
 waiver of premium on disability, and so on.

103
00:06:42,783 --> 00:06:44,643
 The premiums are on the affordable side,

104
00:06:44,723 --> 00:06:48,403
 especially after you add the multiple online and salary discounts they offer.

105
00:06:48,543 --> 00:06:52,483
 You even get a 6% online discount and an additional 5% salary discount.

106
00:06:52,683 --> 00:06:54,323
 Makes it really attractive if you qualify.

107
00:06:54,523 --> 00:06:56,943
 In short, Bajaj Alliance Life brings you affordability,

108
00:06:56,943 --> 00:07:01,563
 a super strong solvency backing and good features though you might want to double check their

109
00:07:01,563 --> 00:07:06,343
 customer service reputation in your city because service consistency can vary a little depending

110
00:07:06,343 --> 00:07:11,023
 on where you are. Moving forward let's get deeper into Axis Maxlife. Maxlife is interesting because

111
00:07:11,023 --> 00:07:16,183
 while it's a standalone life insurance company owned by Max Financial Services, Axis Bank has

112
00:07:16,183 --> 00:07:21,643
 a big 19% stake in it. This has massively boosted their bank assurance reach meaning they sell a lot

113
00:07:21,643 --> 00:07:27,403
 policies through Axis Bank's branches. Now, if you want pure numbers, Max's Life boasts a stellar

114
00:07:27,403 --> 00:07:34,563
 CSR of 99.5%, the highest in the industry among big players. Their amount settlement ratio is at

115
00:07:34,563 --> 00:07:42,723
 96.2% and a mind-blowing 30-day claim settlement rate at 99.69%. Their solvency ratio is a healthy

116
00:07:42,723 --> 00:07:48,403
 1.9, perfectly acceptable by ILDI standards. Max Life's term insurance products, mainly the Smart

117
00:07:48,403 --> 00:07:53,863
 Secure Plus plan and Smart Term Plan Plus offer great flexibility. You can offer increasing

118
00:07:53,863 --> 00:07:57,983
 sum assured income payouts instead of lump sum death benefits and you have good riders

119
00:07:57,983 --> 00:08:02,363
 like Critical Illness and Waver of Premium options. Premiums are also fair, not super

120
00:08:02,363 --> 00:08:06,423
 cheap but definitely value for money if you want that extra assurance of extremely smooth

121
00:08:06,423 --> 00:08:10,543
 claims processing. Their strengths are clearly in their claims handling and bank assurance

122
00:08:10,543 --> 00:08:14,723
 led servicing but if you prefer a company that's more digitally aggressive or direct

123
00:08:14,723 --> 00:08:20,803
 customer friendly there could be slighter flasher options elsewhere all right next is tata aia life

124
00:08:20,803 --> 00:08:25,763
 and honestly this is one company that's really pushing the envelope lately founded in 2001

125
00:08:25,763 --> 00:08:31,763
 tata ai is a joint venture between tata suns the iconic indian conglomerate and aia group asia's

126
00:08:31,763 --> 00:08:38,403
 largest life insurance group their claim settlement ratio is a strong 98.91 with an asr of 95.1 and

127
00:08:38,403 --> 00:08:42,223
 and they settle most claims within 30 days at a rate of 98.27%.

128
00:08:42,223 --> 00:08:45,363
 Their solvency ratio is 1.9, again, absolutely healthy.

129
00:08:45,463 --> 00:08:49,263
 Their main term plans are Sampoorna Raksha Promise or SRP

130
00:08:49,263 --> 00:08:51,723
 and Maharakshya Supreme Select, MRSS.

131
00:08:51,943 --> 00:08:54,523
 These plans give you all the essential bells and whistles,

132
00:08:54,923 --> 00:08:58,023
 return of premium options, income replacement instead of lump sum,

133
00:08:58,283 --> 00:08:59,863
 critical illness riders and more.

134
00:09:00,083 --> 00:09:02,083
 Premiums are middle-ranged, not the cheapest,

135
00:09:02,283 --> 00:09:05,703
 but justified considering the Tata brand reliability and service trend.

136
00:09:05,703 --> 00:09:10,963
 One small thing to note though is that Tata AI's product structures can sometimes feel a little complicated.

137
00:09:11,163 --> 00:09:17,503
 Lots of riders, add-ons, options, multiple payment options, and unless you're carefully advised, it might feel slightly overwhelming.

138
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:22,783
 Post-sales support also has mixed reviews depending on city and branch experience, so something to keep in mind.

139
00:09:22,883 --> 00:09:25,163
 Now, let's move on to Kotak Mahindra Life Insurance.

140
00:09:25,363 --> 00:09:30,563
 Kotak Life is a 100% subsidiary of Kotak Mahindra Bank, one of India's most respected private banks.

141
00:09:30,563 --> 00:09:34,263
 It started operations in 2001 and has built a very stable name for itself.

142
00:09:34,263 --> 00:09:38,543
 Although it's slightly more low-key compared to HTC Life or ICICI Prudential.

143
00:09:38,543 --> 00:09:40,983
 Metrics-wise, Cotec Life does well.

144
00:09:40,983 --> 00:09:58,404
 CSR at 98 30 settlement rate is 99 That basically means you can expect claims to be settled almost immediately without too many follow which is such an underrated thing when you dealing with emotional distress situations Their solvency ratio is 2 which is well above the minimum requirement

145
00:09:58,904 --> 00:10:00,744
 meaning financial safety is not a concern.

146
00:10:00,744 --> 00:10:04,344
 Term plans from Kotak include the e-term plan and Gen2Gen Protect.

147
00:10:04,544 --> 00:10:05,684
 Again, strong basics.

148
00:10:05,904 --> 00:10:09,584
 You get terminal illness covers, waiver of premium options, flexible payout structures.

149
00:10:10,024 --> 00:10:13,584
 Premiums are usually priced comparatively, especially for younger buyers.

150
00:10:13,584 --> 00:10:17,524
 Kotak Life's strengths are financial stability and very low claim hassles.

151
00:10:17,524 --> 00:10:22,484
 But the trade-off is they aren't as aggressive or innovative with product features as some

152
00:10:22,484 --> 00:10:23,604
 newer players.

153
00:10:23,604 --> 00:10:28,264
 So if you value quiet reliability over fancy features, Kotak is a decent option.

154
00:10:28,264 --> 00:10:31,224
 Alright, next up, PNB MetLife India Insurance.

155
00:10:31,224 --> 00:10:35,004
 This company is a joint venture between Punjab National Bank and MetLife International Holdings

156
00:10:35,004 --> 00:10:36,004
 from the US.

157
00:10:36,004 --> 00:10:40,684
 It's been around since 2001 and taps heavily into India's semi-urban and rural belt thanks

158
00:10:40,684 --> 00:10:41,964
 to PNB's branch networks.

159
00:10:41,964 --> 00:10:47,264
 They've got a CSR of 98.5% and amount settlement ratio of 95.5%.

160
00:10:47,264 --> 00:10:53,964
 Their 30-day settlement speed is 96.17, slightly lower compared to MaxLife and HJC Lives, but still solid.

161
00:10:54,084 --> 00:10:56,084
 Their solvency ratio is 1.9%.

162
00:10:56,084 --> 00:11:00,184
 Their main term products are Mera Term Plan and Ajeevan Suraksha Plan.

163
00:11:00,384 --> 00:11:03,524
 These are strong products, but, and it's an important but,

164
00:11:03,624 --> 00:11:07,164
 P&B MetLife sees slightly higher complaint volumes compared to Peers.

165
00:11:07,284 --> 00:11:11,444
 About 55 complaints per 10,000 claims settled, which is higher than the industry average.

166
00:11:11,444 --> 00:11:19,044
 So, while their products and coverages are good, customer service might sometimes feel slower or less responsive, especially in rural setups.

167
00:11:19,304 --> 00:11:26,724
 So, if your main goal is low premiums and your banking relationship with PNB or associated banks, then PNB MetLife can work well.

168
00:11:26,864 --> 00:11:28,864
 Just be aware that service experience can vary.

169
00:11:29,184 --> 00:11:33,124
 And finally, Aditya Birla Sun Life Insurance or ABSLI for short.

170
00:11:33,204 --> 00:11:37,824
 This is a joint venture between Aditya Birla Capital and Sun Life Financial from Canada.

171
00:11:37,824 --> 00:11:41,424
 They've been around since 2001 again and while they've started slow,

172
00:11:41,804 --> 00:11:43,924
 they've become pretty strong players over the last decade.

173
00:11:44,164 --> 00:11:45,284
 Metrics-wise, very stable.

174
00:11:45,484 --> 00:11:47,324
 CSR, 98.65%.

175
00:11:47,324 --> 00:11:49,144
 ASR, 94.3%.

176
00:11:49,144 --> 00:11:55,104
 30-day settlement rate at 99.39% and solvency rate is at 1.8%, which is good.

177
00:11:55,264 --> 00:11:58,624
 They offer plans like DigiShield, Salary Term Plan and Income Surreptiture Plan.

178
00:11:58,764 --> 00:12:02,764
 DigiShield is especially versatile because it offers you 10 different customization options

179
00:12:02,764 --> 00:12:06,324
 like increasing cover, income replacement, staggered payouts and so on.

180
00:12:06,324 --> 00:12:11,584
 Premiums are generally reasonable and they're particularly strong when it comes to salaried customer discounts.

181
00:12:11,584 --> 00:12:14,704
 Their strengths? Very low complaint volumes compared to peers,

182
00:12:14,704 --> 00:12:18,384
 pretty straightforward service and a fairly wide range of customizable products.

183
00:12:18,384 --> 00:12:24,044
 The one small watch out is that they're not as heavily digital-first as some competitors like HTFC Life,

184
00:12:24,044 --> 00:12:25,344
 but they're catching up.

185
00:12:25,344 --> 00:12:32,024
 And that's the full set folks, all major players, all major metrics, all features and real-world nuances properly covered.

186
00:12:32,024 --> 00:12:33,064
 Just like you had asked.

187
00:12:33,064 --> 00:12:34,444
 Also, one last thing.

188
00:12:34,444 --> 00:12:36,984
 Just because someone has high claim settlement ratio

189
00:12:36,984 --> 00:12:39,424
 doesn't mean that they're the right insurer for you.

190
00:12:39,524 --> 00:12:40,704
 It all depends on your needs

191
00:12:40,704 --> 00:12:42,724
 and that's where Ditto can really help you.
