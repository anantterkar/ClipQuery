1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,480
 You might be planning a baby or maybe just thinking about it. Either way, maternity costs in 2025 are no joke.

2
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:16,420
 In cities like Mumbai, Delhi, Pune, even Ahmedabad, the delivery itself can just cost you around 25,000 rupees to 1.25 lakh rupees.

3
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:26,280
 And that's for a normal or C-sectional delivery. Add in prenatal checkups, scans, medications, NICU bills, vaccinations and the numbers balloons up really fast.

4
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:30,340
 So naturally, the next question becomes, can insurance help with this?

5
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:33,780
 Short answer, yes. Long answer, it depends.

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,700
 Maternity insurance is a tricky space, full of fine print, waiting periods,

7
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,960
 sublimits, expensive riders and hidden conditions as well.

8
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:42,980
 So in this video, we'll break it all down.

9
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:46,540

10
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:48,600

00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:53,220
 We'll cover waiting periods, coverage limits, advanced features like IVF or surrogacy,

12
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:56,160
 newborn coverage and even actual premium coats.

13
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:59,920
 And just like our ultimate term guide, there are chapters in the description.

14
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:04,000

17
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,680
 The link is in the description.

18
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:13,900
 Alright, let's dive in.

19
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:16,980
 Now, before we head to the plans, let me give you a quick reality check.

20
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:21,200
 A maternity policy isn't like a regular health insurance because it's built around a high

21
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,700
 probability short-term event, which means insurers protect themselves through five common

22
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:26,140
 restrictions.

23
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:29,520
 Number one, waiting periods ranging from nine months to four years.

24
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:34,700
 So if you're already pregnant or planning next year, many plans may not be useful right now.

25
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:35,960
 Number two, sublimits.

26
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:39,160
 Fixed caps on maternity claims like 40,000 or 60,000 rupees.

27
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:42,260
 If your bill is one lakh, you pay the rest by yourself.

28
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:44,020
 Third, higher premiums.

29
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:47,280
 Plans with maternity bundled in can be twice as expensive.

30
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:49,300
 Fourth, dual coverage rule.

31
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:52,880
 Many policies require both spouses to be insured under the same plan.

32
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:54,680
 And finally, no refund clause.

33
00:01:54,680 --> 00:02:11,434
 If maternity is bundled into your base plan you continue paying that high premium even after you done with kids That why our advice is always check your corporate cover first Corporate health policies often have no waiting periods generous maternity limit and built newborn cover And they typically paid by your employer

34
00:02:11,734 --> 00:02:16,534
 But if you don't have a company plan or need a personal policy, here are the best options

35
