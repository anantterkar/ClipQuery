[72.88 - 73.90]  Alright, let's dive in.
[73.98 - 76.98]  Now, before we head to the plans, let me give you a quick reality check.
[77.08 - 81.20]  A maternity policy isn't like a regular health insurance because it's built around a high
[81.20 - 85.70]  probability short-term event, which means insurers protect themselves through five common
[85.70 - 86.14]  restrictions.
[86.28 - 89.52]  Number one, waiting periods ranging from nine months to four years.
[89.84 - 94.70]  So if you're already pregnant or planning next year, many plans may not be useful right now.
[94.82 - 95.96]  Number two, sublimits.
[96.14 - 99.16]  Fixed caps on maternity claims like 40,000 or 60,000 rupees.
[99.62 - 102.26]  If your bill is one lakh, you pay the rest by yourself.
[102.46 - 104.02]  Third, higher premiums.
[104.12 - 107.28]  Plans with maternity bundled in can be twice as expensive.
[107.62 - 109.30]  Fourth, dual coverage rule.
[109.56 - 112.88]  Many policies require both spouses to be insured under the same plan.
[113.06 - 114.68]  And finally, no refund clause.
[114.68 - 131.43]  If maternity is bundled into your base plan you continue paying that high premium even after you done with kids That why our advice is always check your corporate cover first Corporate health policies often have no waiting periods generous maternity limit and built newborn cover And they typically paid by your employer
