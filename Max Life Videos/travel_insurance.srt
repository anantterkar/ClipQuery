1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,520
I don't need to tell you the thrill of travelling.

2
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:10,480
Whether you visit in the scenic beaches of Thailand or exploring through aesthetic city

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:11,800
streets of Italy.

4
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:15,519
There is nothing quite like the excitement of packing your bags and hopping onto the

5
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:16,839
very next flight.

6
00:00:16,839 --> 00:00:18,240
But let's be here.

7
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,320
Travel can also come with its own set of untradictable plot twists.

8
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:28,000
Lost luggage, missed flights or a sudden illness can turn your dream vacation into a stressful

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
mess.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,920

11
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,719

Now let's start with today's topic.

18
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:55,719
Travel insurance.

19
00:00:55,719 --> 00:01:00,799
At its core travel insurance is your financial safety net wherever you are travelling abroad.

20
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:06,280
It covers everything from emergency medical treatment to dental procedures and even steps in if

21
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:08,879
you face accidents during your journey.

22
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:10,079
But that's not all.

23
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:16,159
It also has your back if you need to cancel your trip in the end or if you lose your luggage

24
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:19,759
or even if your home gets burglarized when you are away.

25
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:23,960
Now when it comes to types of travel insurance you've got two main options.

26
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:29,399
First there's single trip insurance perfect for those one of adventures lasting up to

27
00:01:29,399 --> 00:01:30,559
180 days.

28
00:01:30,559 --> 00:01:36,059
Then we have multi trip insurance which is ideal for frequent travelers who make multiple

29
00:01:36,059 --> 00:01:37,759
trips within a year.

30
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:39,919
Typically covering 30 to 60 days per trip.

31
00:01:39,919 --> 00:01:42,719
Now let's talk about why travel insurance is great.

32
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:48,159
Well it's comprehensive covering a wide range of travel risks and it won't break the

33
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:53,599
bank compared to international medical insurance which will come to in a later stage.

34
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:58,000
Plus getting it is as easy as ordering your morning coffee.

35
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,119
The application process is super simple but like everything else it does have its limitations.

36
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:08,519
It's primarily designed for shorter stays so if you're planning to be abroad for an extended

37
00:02:08,519 --> 00:02:10,840
period then you might want to think twice.

38
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:16,159
Also it mainly covers emergency medical treatment so don't count on it for routine checkups and

39
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:17,159
here's a big one.

40
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:22,319
If you have any PDs that is pre-existing medical conditions you might find yourself in a tight

41
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:24,560
spot as these are often excluded.

42
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,280
Now let's look at some of the best travel insurance options available in India.

43
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:34,120
First up is HTFC Ergo which gives you access to over 1 lakh cashless hospital worldwide.

incidents.

some fantastic discounts for families.

58
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,840
One standout feature is their geographical flexibility.

59
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:33,840
That is you can choose worldwide coverage or exclude specific regions based on your needs.

60
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:38,840
Plus they provide loyalty benefits for returning customers making it a great choice for frequent

evacuation and repatriation of remains.

66
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:03,319
What sets them apart is their specialized options for senior citizens and their comprehensive

67
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:04,719
family coverage plan.

68
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:08,560
They also provide flexibility in selecting geographical coverage allowing you to customize

69
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,599
the plan based on your destination just like Tata AIG.

70
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:16,040
Next up, ICICI Lombards International Travel Insurance really stands out with its

71
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,040
age range.

72
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,400
It covers people from 3 months to 85 years.

members during hospitalization and coverage for political risk and catastrophic evacuations.

00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:35,680
Their daily hospitalization allowance aids extra financial security and they provide value

76
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,040
added services for dependence back home.

77
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:42,280
Plus there is no medical test required for policy issues making it incredibly convenient.

78
00:04:42,279 --> 00:04:47,839
Now, let's switch gears and talk about medical insurance with international coverage.

79
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:51,159
This is the heavy hitter of the international insurance options.

80
00:04:51,159 --> 00:04:55,959
Unlike travel insurance, this type of coverage is designed for both emergency and planned

81
00:04:55,959 --> 00:04:57,239
medical procedures abroad.

82
00:04:57,239 --> 00:05:02,599
It's perfect for those who might need extensive medical care while travelling or living overseas.

83
00:05:02,599 --> 00:05:04,639
The advantages are very significant.

84
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:08,799
You get comprehensive medical coverage for both emergency and planned treatment, metadetic

85
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:13,800
coverage in some plans and many policies cover PEDs after a waiting period.

86
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:19,199
Plus, you can customize these plans with add-ons and wellness programs as well.

87
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,240
However, there are some drawbacks to consider.

88
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:27,040
The premiums are significantly higher than standard travel insurance and you might face deductibles

89
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:30,000
and copayments before your coverage kicks in.

90
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Some plans also exclude high cost countries like the US and Canada and their generally only

91
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,840
available to resident Indians.

92
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:41,719
Let's dive deeper into the medical insurance plans with international coverage options.

93
00:05:41,719 --> 00:05:47,799
First up, HCFC Optima Secure Global Plus is a powerhouse offering base coverage of

94
00:05:47,799 --> 00:05:51,719
1-2-2 crores with no copayment or room and interstictions.

95
00:05:51,719 --> 00:05:54,039
What's impressive is their benefit structure.

96
00:05:54,039 --> 00:05:59,279
You get a 50% increase up to 100% irrespective of claims with no clawback.

97
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:03,639
They offer both cashless and reimbursement options with a small, ten-kid deductible

98
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:05,159
for international claims.

99
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:11,280
The plan includes comprehensive pre- and post-hospitalization coverage for 60 and 180 days respectively

100
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,960
and even covers consumables both in India and globally.

101
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,880
Next up, Care Advantage Plus with Global Cover.

102
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:23,400

00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:41,399
the base cover.

00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:44,840
Plus, they offer OPT coverage with specific consultation limits.

109
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:50,399
Next up, Niva Boopa Health Premium Platinum stands out with its unique combination of

110
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:52,079

Their enhanced geographical scope add-ons extend coverage to the US and Canada making it

115
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,040
truly comprehensive.

116
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:16,879
Next up, the Niva Boopa Aspire with BODELESS add-on is particularly interesting.

Their boost-up plus benefit carries forward unutilized cover up to 10 times the base sum

121
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:31,920
in short.

122
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:35,680

Their plan stands out with features like claim protect for consumables and super reload

128
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,759
for unlimited restoration.

129
00:07:55,759 --> 00:08:00,400
Now let me share some real-world examples to help you understand better if you should

130
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:03,319
get a travel insurance or a medical insurance.

131
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:08,359
Take Asshama for example a 26 year old entrepreneur who frequently travels to UK, Australia and

132
00:08:08,359 --> 00:08:12,719
New Zealand for business, which stable finances and frequent short trips she's perfect for

133
00:08:12,719 --> 00:08:14,959
an international medical insurance plan.

134
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:15,959
Then there's Anita.

135
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:20,319
A 35 year old ID professional planning a family Christmas trip abroad.

136
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:25,319
Since it's a one time holiday trip, travel insurance would be ideal for her and her family.

137
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:29,239
Consider Sino, a 30 year old starting her fabric business.

138
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,920
Getting to visit Bangladesh for a month long training.

139
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:36,200
With unstable finances, travel insurance makes more sense for a 30 day stir.

140
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:41,440
And finally we have Hina, a 40 year old planning knee replacement surgery in the UK giving

141
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,320
her stable finances in the nature of her medical treatment.

142
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:49,440
Medical insurance with medical international coverage would be her best bet.

143
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,879
Now the question is when to choose which type of insurance.

144
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:57,399
You see travel insurance is essentially your short term safety net focusing primarily on

145
00:08:57,399 --> 00:08:59,959
emergency situations and travel related issues.

146
00:08:59,959 --> 00:09:04,120
It's designed for those quick business trips or family vacations offering protection against

147
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:09,679
unexpected medical emergency strip cancellation, laws, baggage and other unrelated mishaps.

148
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:13,159
Medical insurance with international coverage on the other hand is your comprehensive

149
00:09:13,159 --> 00:09:14,159
health protection abroad.

150
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:17,799
It's like having your regular health insurance but with a global reach.

151
00:09:17,799 --> 00:09:21,679
The key difference lies in the depth of coverage while travel insurance might cover that

152
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:23,679
emergency appendectomy.

153
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:28,199
International medical insurance would cover everything from routine checkups to plant surgeries

154
00:09:28,199 --> 00:09:30,959
and even ongoing treatments for chronic conditions.

155
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:32,199
Think of it this way.

156
00:09:32,199 --> 00:09:35,279
Travel insurance is like carrying a first aid kit for your journey.

157
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:39,439
Essential for immediate emergencies but limited in scope.

158
00:09:39,439 --> 00:09:42,759
International medical insurance is more like having your entire health care system in your

159
00:09:42,759 --> 00:09:46,120
pocket ready to use wherever you are in the world.

160
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:49,399
The cause difference reflects this disparity in coverage.

161
00:09:49,399 --> 00:09:53,439
Travel insurance is typically more affordable because it's designed for short term emergency

162
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,520
only coverage.

163
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:58,560
International medical insurance commands higher premiums but provides the peace of mind

164
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:03,400
of knowing you're covered for any health related situation, plant or unplanned.

165
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:07,360
As we wrap up folks let's remember that choosing between travel insurance and medical

166
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,760
insurance with an international coverage isn't just about cost.

167
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:14,080
It's about understanding your specific needs and circumstances.

168
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:17,680
Consider your travel frequency the nature of your trips and your health conditions and

169
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,680
also your budget.

170
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:22,520
For frequent travelers or those planning extended stays abroad.

171
00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:25,439
Medical insurance might be worth the higher premiums.

172
00:10:25,439 --> 00:10:30,759
For occasional travelers or those on short trips travel insurance might be more practical

173
00:10:30,759 --> 00:10:31,759
choice.

174
00:10:31,759 --> 00:10:36,079
Remember to review the specific benefits, exclusions and claim procedures of any policies

175
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:37,079
you're considering.

176
00:10:37,079 --> 00:10:41,679
Pay attention to geographical inflation, coverage caps and any waiting periods that might

177
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:42,679
apply.

178
00:10:42,679 --> 00:10:46,159
An important note folks at Ditto we want to be completely transparent with you.

179
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:50,639
Our advisory services are primarily limited to health insurance coverage with an India

180
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:52,199
and term life insurance.

181
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:56,759
While we've provided this comprehensive overview of travel insurance options, we don't

182
00:10:56,759 --> 00:11:00,360
currently facilitate travel insurance purchases throughout the platform.

183
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:03,720
Additionally when it comes to health insurance policies with international coverage we want

184
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:07,640
to be upfront about the fact that we have limited experience with the claim processes.

185
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:11,280
Since we haven't processed many cases in this area we can't provide detailed insight

186
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:14,440
into how smoothly these claims work in practice.

187
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:18,560
The work of insurance can be complex but making an informed decision about your coverage

188
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:21,640
can save you from significant stress and financial burden.

189
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:22,639
Take your time.

190
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:26,360
Evaluate your options carefully and choose the coverage that best fits your specific

191
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,679
situation and needs.

192
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:30,759
And if you need us to do the heavy lifting you know where to find us.

193
00:11:30,759 --> 00:11:32,480
Thanks for watching folks.

194
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,840
Happy insurance hunting and safe travels.
