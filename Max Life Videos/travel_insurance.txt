[15.52 - 16.84] very next flight.
[16.84 - 18.24] But let's be here.
[18.24 - 22.32] Travel can also come with its own set of untradictable plot twists.
[22.32 - 28.00] Lost luggage, missed flights or a sudden illness can turn your dream vacation into a stressful
[28.00 - 29.00] mess.
[29.00 - 32.92] And while we are dead or don't specifically deal with travel insurance because we focus
[32.92 - 35.72] primarily on health and term insurance only.

[49.72 - 51.96] Today and get personalized advice.
[51.96 - 54.56] Now let's start with today's topic.
[54.56 - 55.72] Travel insurance.
[55.72 - 60.80] At its core travel insurance is your financial safety net wherever you are travelling abroad.
[60.80 - 66.28] It covers everything from emergency medical treatment to dental procedures and even steps in if
[66.28 - 68.88] you face accidents during your journey.
[68.88 - 70.08] But that's not all.
[70.08 - 76.16] It also has your back if you need to cancel your trip in the end or if you lose your luggage
[76.16 - 79.76] or even if your home gets burglarized when you are away.
[79.76 - 83.96] Now when it comes to types of travel insurance you've got two main options.
[83.96 - 89.40] First there's single trip insurance perfect for those one of adventures lasting up to
[89.40 - 90.56] 180 days.
[90.56 - 96.06] Then we have multi trip insurance which is ideal for frequent travelers who make multiple
[96.06 - 97.76] trips within a year.
[97.76 - 99.92] Typically covering 30 to 60 days per trip.
[99.92 - 102.72] Now let's talk about why travel insurance is great.
[102.72 - 108.16] Well it's comprehensive covering a wide range of travel risks and it won't break the
[108.16 - 113.60] bank compared to international medical insurance which will come to in a later stage.
[113.60 - 118.00] Plus getting it is as easy as ordering your morning coffee.
[118.00 - 123.12] The application process is super simple but like everything else it does have its limitations.
[123.12 - 128.52] It's primarily designed for shorter stays so if you're planning to be abroad for an extended
[128.52 - 130.84] period then you might want to think twice.
[130.84 - 136.16] Also it mainly covers emergency medical treatment so don't count on it for routine checkups and
[136.16 - 137.16] here's a big one.
[137.16 - 142.32] If you have any PDs that is pre-existing medical conditions you might find yourself in a tight
[142.32 - 144.56] spot as these are often excluded.
[144.56 - 148.28] Now let's look at some of the best travel insurance options available in India.
[148.28 - 154.12] First up is HTFC Ergo which gives you access to over 1 lakh cashless hospital worldwide.
[154.12 - 158.60] They've got you covered for everything from medical emergencies to COVID-19 related
[158.60 - 159.60] incidents.

[165.24 - 167.84] makers with family coverage options as well.

[172.88 - 176.56] and disability coverage and financial assistance if you get robbed.
[176.56 - 180.88] What's great is that they cover people from 6 months to 70 years old and you can choose
[180.88 - 184.40] between single trips or annual multitript plans.
[184.40 - 189.32] Next up, Tata AIG's Travel Guard Plus is another excellent option offering coverage from
[189.32 - 192.44] $50,000 up to $1 million.
[192.44 - 196.28] They're particularly great with instant claim settlements and have special provisions
[196.28 - 197.80] for senior citizens.
[197.80 - 202.88] Their coverage extends to emergency medical evacuation, repatriation costs and they offer
[202.88 - 205.60] some fantastic discounts for families.
[205.60 - 208.84] One standout feature is their geographical flexibility.

[218.84 - 219.84] travelers.
[219.84 - 226.12] Next up, Bajaj Alihan's individual travel insurance plan matches these impressive coverage
[226.12 - 231.40] limits ranging from $50,000 again up to $1 million.

[243.32 - 244.72] family coverage plan.
[244.72 - 248.56] They also provide flexibility in selecting geographical coverage allowing you to customize
[248.56 - 251.60] the plan based on your destination just like Tata AIG.
[251.60 - 256.04] Next up, ICICI Lombards International Travel Insurance really stands out with its
[256.04 - 257.04] age range.

[282.28 - 287.84] Now, let's switch gears and talk about medical insurance with international coverage.
[287.84 - 291.16] This is the heavy hitter of the international insurance options.
[291.16 - 295.96] Unlike travel insurance, this type of coverage is designed for both emergency and planned
[295.96 - 297.24] medical procedures abroad.
[297.24 - 302.60] It's perfect for those who might need extensive medical care while travelling or living overseas.
[302.60 - 304.64] The advantages are very significant.
[304.64 - 308.80] You get comprehensive medical coverage for both emergency and planned treatment, metadetic
[308.80 - 313.80] coverage in some plans and many policies cover PEDs after a waiting period.
[313.80 - 319.20] Plus, you can customize these plans with add-ons and wellness programs as well.
[319.20 - 322.24] However, there are some drawbacks to consider.
[322.24 - 327.04] The premiums are significantly higher than standard travel insurance and you might face deductibles
[327.04 - 330.00] and copayments before your coverage kicks in.
[330.00 - 335.00] Some plans also exclude high cost countries like the US and Canada and their generally only
[335.00 - 336.84] available to resident Indians.
[336.84 - 341.72] Let's dive deeper into the medical insurance plans with international coverage options.
[341.72 - 347.80] First up, HCFC Optima Secure Global Plus is a powerhouse offering base coverage of
[347.80 - 351.72] 1-2-2 crores with no copayment or room and interstictions.
[351.72 - 354.04] What's impressive is their benefit structure.

[359.28 - 363.64] They offer both cashless and reimbursement options with a small, ten-kid deductible

[365.16 - 371.28] The plan includes comprehensive pre- and post-hospitalization coverage for 60 and 180 days respectively
[371.28 - 374.96] and even covers consumables both in India and globally.

[469.72 - 473.92] Their plan stands out with features like claim protect for consumables and super reload
[473.92 - 475.76] for unlimited restoration.
[475.76 - 480.40] Now let me share some real-world examples to help you understand better if you should
[480.40 - 483.32] get a travel insurance or a medical insurance.
[483.32 - 488.36] Take Asshama for example a 26 year old entrepreneur who frequently travels to UK, Australia and
[488.36 - 492.72] New Zealand for business, which stable finances and frequent short trips she's perfect for
[492.72 - 494.96] an international medical insurance plan.
[494.96 - 495.96] Then there's Anita.
[495.96 - 500.32] A 35 year old ID professional planning a family Christmas trip abroad.
[500.32 - 505.32] Since it's a one time holiday trip, travel insurance would be ideal for her and her family.
[505.32 - 509.24] Consider Sino, a 30 year old starting her fabric business.
[509.24 - 511.92] Getting to visit Bangladesh for a month long training.
[511.92 - 516.20] With unstable finances, travel insurance makes more sense for a 30 day stir.
[516.20 - 521.44] And finally we have Hina, a 40 year old planning knee replacement surgery in the UK giving
[521.44 - 525.32] her stable finances in the nature of her medical treatment.
[525.32 - 529.44] Medical insurance with medical international coverage would be her best bet.
[529.44 - 532.88] Now the question is when to choose which type of insurance.
[532.88 - 537.40] You see travel insurance is essentially your short term safety net focusing primarily on
[537.40 - 539.96] emergency situations and travel related issues.
[539.96 - 544.12] It's designed for those quick business trips or family vacations offering protection against
[544.12 - 549.68] unexpected medical emergency strip cancellation, laws, baggage and other unrelated mishaps.
[549.68 - 553.16] Medical insurance with international coverage on the other hand is your comprehensive
[553.16 - 554.16] health protection abroad.
[554.16 - 557.80] It's like having your regular health insurance but with a global reach.
[557.80 - 561.68] The key difference lies in the depth of coverage while travel insurance might cover that
[561.68 - 563.68] emergency appendectomy.
[563.68 - 568.20] International medical insurance would cover everything from routine checkups to plant surgeries
[568.20 - 570.96] and even ongoing treatments for chronic conditions.
[570.96 - 572.20] Think of it this way.
[572.20 - 575.28] Travel insurance is like carrying a first aid kit for your journey.
[575.28 - 579.44] Essential for immediate emergencies but limited in scope.
[579.44 - 582.76] International medical insurance is more like having your entire health care system in your
[582.76 - 586.12] pocket ready to use wherever you are in the world.
[586.12 - 589.40] The cause difference reflects this disparity in coverage.
[589.40 - 593.44] Travel insurance is typically more affordable because it's designed for short term emergency
[593.52 - 594.52] only coverage.
[594.52 - 598.56] International medical insurance commands higher premiums but provides the peace of mind
[598.56 - 603.40] of knowing you're covered for any health related situation, plant or unplanned.
[603.40 - 607.36] As we wrap up folks let's remember that choosing between travel insurance and medical
[607.36 - 610.76] insurance with an international coverage isn't just about cost.
[610.76 - 614.08] It's about understanding your specific needs and circumstances.
[614.08 - 617.68] Consider your travel frequency the nature of your trips and your health conditions and
[617.68 - 618.68] also your budget.
[618.68 - 622.52] For frequent travelers or those planning extended stays abroad.
[622.52 - 625.44] Medical insurance might be worth the higher premiums.
[625.44 - 630.76] For occasional travelers or those on short trips travel insurance might be more practical
[630.76 - 631.76] choice.
[631.76 - 636.08] Remember to review the specific benefits, exclusions and claim procedures of any policies
[636.08 - 637.08] you're considering.
[637.08 - 641.68] Pay attention to geographical inflation, coverage caps and any waiting periods that might
[641.68 - 642.68] apply.
[642.68 - 646.16] An important note folks at Ditto we want to be completely transparent with you.
[646.16 - 650.64] Our advisory services are primarily limited to health insurance coverage with an India
[650.64 - 652.20] and term life insurance.
[652.20 - 656.76] While we've provided this comprehensive overview of travel insurance options, we don't
[656.76 - 660.36] currently facilitate travel insurance purchases throughout the platform.
[660.36 - 663.72] Additionally when it comes to health insurance policies with international coverage we want
[663.72 - 667.64] to be upfront about the fact that we have limited experience with the claim processes.
[667.64 - 671.28] Since we haven't processed many cases in this area we can't provide detailed insight
[671.28 - 674.44] into how smoothly these claims work in practice.
[674.44 - 678.56] The work of insurance can be complex but making an informed decision about your coverage
[678.56 - 681.64] can save you from significant stress and financial burden.
[681.64 - 682.64] Take your time.
[682.64 - 686.36] Evaluate your options carefully and choose the coverage that best fits your specific
[686.36 - 687.68] situation and needs.
[687.68 - 690.76] And if you need us to do the heavy lifting you know where to find us.
[690.76 - 692.48] Thanks for watching folks.
[692.48 - 694.84] Happy insurance hunting and safe travels.
