1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:05,620
 You probably have a health insurance policy or maybe your company gave you one.

2
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:10,080
 But if I asked you, what's your room rent limit or do you have a copay clause,

3
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:12,640
 would you be able to answer? Now that's the problem.

4
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:17,200
 Most of us have health insurance on paper, but when it's actually time to use it,

5
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:20,860
 we have no idea how it works. And that can cost you a lot,

6
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:25,220
 emotionally, financially, and even medically, which is why we made this video.

7
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,820
 This is your ultimate health insurance guide.

8
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:32,940
 We're going to cover everything from the basics like what health insurance is and why it matters

9
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:38,580
 to the complex stuff like exclusions, restoration benefits, waiting periods, top-ups, super top-ups

10
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:41,640
 and even how to file a claim when you're under pressure.

11
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,600
 And yes, this will be quite a long video but we've added chapters in the description

12
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,140
 so you can skip to any section you want.

13
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,620
 Or better, watch it all in one go and walk away knowing exactly how to choose,

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,300
 use and get the most out of your health insurance.

15
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:59,860
 And if you still feel lost after this, just book a free call with Ditto's advisors.

16
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:02,960
 We will not spam you. We will not pressurize you.

17
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:05,020
 Just solid advice will be given to you.

18
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:06,400
 The link is in the description.

19
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:07,920
 Alright, let's get into it.

20
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:12,880
 So, what is health insurance and why does everyone say it's so important?

21
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:16,400
 It's basically a deal between you and an insurance company.

22
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:20,940
 You pay them a premium every year and they agree to cover your medical expenses

23
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:24,840
 like hospital stays, surgeries, daycare procedures and more

24
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,620
 as per the terms of the policy.

25
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:29,260
 It's meant to prevent you from draining your savings

26
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:30,560
 during a health emergency.

27
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,040
 Because let's face it,

28
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,320
 medical costs today are insane.

29
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:35,920
 Even a simple surgery can cost

30
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,720
 2 to 3 lakh rupees in a good hospital.

31
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:39,860
 A few days in the ICU can burn through

32
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:41,720
 5-6 lakh rupees just like that.

33
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,720
 Now, without insurance,

34
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,100
 it's a financial disaster waiting to happen.

35
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,140
 It also saves you tax under Section 80D

36
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:48,720
 if you're on the old tax regime.

37
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,920
 So yes, it's not just protection,

38
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,380
 it's smart financial planning.

39
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:57,020
 Now, let's bust some common myths we hear literally every day.

40
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:59,380
 I'm young and healthy, I don't need insurance.

41
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:11,705
 Wrong Accidents don ask for your age and lifestyle illnesses are hitting people in their 20s now Buy young get lower premiums and clear your waiting periods early My office already gives me insurance

42
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:15,245
 Sure, but what happens when you switch jobs or retire?

43
00:02:15,425 --> 00:02:16,405
 That coverage ends.

44
00:02:16,805 --> 00:02:18,765
 You need a personal plan as your backup.

45
00:02:18,905 --> 00:02:21,585
 Next one. Insurance covers everything, right?

46
00:02:21,765 --> 00:02:23,605
 Nope. Every policy has limits.

47
00:02:23,945 --> 00:02:26,465
 Room rent caps, co-pays, waiting periods, exclusions.

48
00:02:26,745 --> 00:02:29,005
 That's why people get shocked during claims.

49
00:02:29,005 --> 00:02:30,885
 You have to know your policy.

50
00:02:31,105 --> 00:02:33,305
 Now, let's talk about types of health insurance.

51
00:02:33,805 --> 00:02:35,205
 Which one should you even get?

52
00:02:35,385 --> 00:02:38,565
 There's individual insurance where you get the full cover to yourself.

53
00:02:38,725 --> 00:02:41,705
 This is good if you're single or have specific medical needs.

54
00:02:41,945 --> 00:02:43,605
 Then there's family floater plans.

55
00:02:43,825 --> 00:02:46,525
 The entire family shares one sum insured.

56
00:02:46,685 --> 00:02:51,925
 Cheaper, yes, but if one person claims a lot, there's less left for the rest.

57
00:02:52,125 --> 00:02:53,665
 Next, senior citizen plans.

58
00:02:53,665 --> 00:02:57,585
 Folks over 60 usually come with copays and tougher underwriting,

59
00:02:57,585 --> 00:02:59,665
 but they cater to age-related issues.

60
00:02:59,665 --> 00:03:01,505
 Next up, super top-up plans.

61
00:03:01,505 --> 00:03:02,785
 This is a secret hack.

62
00:03:02,785 --> 00:03:06,785
 You pay for small hospital bills out of pocket or use a base policy,

63
00:03:06,785 --> 00:03:10,705
 but once the bill crosses say 3 lakh rupees, the top-up kicks in.

64
00:03:10,705 --> 00:03:14,865
 You can get a 20 lakh rupee cover extra at a super low cost.

65
00:03:14,865 --> 00:03:18,305
 Also, there is corporate plans from your employer and group plans

66
00:03:18,305 --> 00:03:20,545
 from alumni networks, banks, etc.

67
00:03:20,545 --> 00:03:23,265
 But these are rarely enough by themselves.

68
00:03:23,265 --> 00:03:24,745
 Now, let's talk features.

69
00:03:24,745 --> 00:03:27,665
 These are what make or break your claim experience.

70
00:03:27,665 --> 00:03:28,145
 Copay.

71
00:03:28,145 --> 00:03:30,825
 You'll have to pay a percentage of every bill.

72
00:03:30,825 --> 00:03:33,585
 It's usually forced on senior citizen plans.

73
00:03:33,585 --> 00:03:35,625
 If you can avoid it, please do.

74
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:36,465
 Room rent limit.

75
00:03:36,465 --> 00:03:37,865
 Now, this one's nasty.

76
00:03:37,865 --> 00:03:41,145
 If your room rent is capped at Rs. 5000 per day,

77
00:03:41,145 --> 00:03:43,625
 but you take a Rs. 8000 per day room,

78
00:03:43,625 --> 00:03:46,145
 the insurer might reduce your entire claim,

79
00:03:46,145 --> 00:03:47,305
 not just the rent part.

80
00:03:47,305 --> 00:03:48,745
 Sublimits on diseases.

81
00:03:48,745 --> 00:03:50,985
 Like cataract cap at Rs. 30k.

82
00:03:50,985 --> 00:03:52,625
 If the surgery costs Rs. 50,000,

83
00:03:52,625 --> 00:03:55,625
 you pay the difference. Again, not an ideal situation.

84
00:03:55,625 --> 00:04:02,065
 Pre and post hospitalization. This covers tests and medicines done 60 days before and 180 days after admission.

85
00:04:02,065 --> 00:04:16,651
 Different for different policies and this is a must have The more the number of days the better Next daycare procedures Not all surgeries need 24 hours now Good policies cover 500 plus procedures of these types Restoration If you use your cover this feature refills it

86
00:04:17,011 --> 00:04:18,631
 Crucial if multiple people are covered

87
00:04:18,631 --> 00:04:20,911
 or if you're dealing with back-to-back hospitalization.

88
00:04:21,171 --> 00:04:22,211
 Next is no claim bonus.

89
00:04:22,611 --> 00:04:24,391
 You get a bonus for every claim free year.

90
00:04:24,791 --> 00:04:27,191
 Some plans give 50% more cover per year,

91
00:04:27,291 --> 00:04:29,451
 but some also reduce the bonus if you make a claim.

92
00:04:29,791 --> 00:04:30,651
 So, check that.

93
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:32,071
 Next up, maternity cover.

94
00:04:32,191 --> 00:04:33,571
 Comes with long waiting periods,

95
00:04:33,571 --> 00:04:34,691
 usually two to four years.

96
00:04:34,731 --> 00:04:40,711
 only opt for it if you're planning a family soon. OPD and health checkups. They sound nice but are

97
00:04:40,711 --> 00:04:45,651
 often not worth with high premiums. Use them only if you really need them. Next up, we have

98
00:04:45,651 --> 00:04:51,971
 waiting periods. All these features that we just narrated, we have made an in-depth video explaining

99
00:04:51,971 --> 00:04:58,071
 each one of these benefits. I will link them in the description below. This is a part of Health

100
00:04:58,071 --> 00:05:03,011
 101 series that we've done. It's a playlist. Again, I'll link it in the description for you to see.

101
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:06,171
 Alright, now moving on to waiting periods.

102
00:05:06,411 --> 00:05:08,011
 Every policy has them.

103
00:05:08,351 --> 00:05:10,391
 And there are different kinds of waiting periods.

104
00:05:10,671 --> 00:05:14,091
 The usual 30 days for general hospitalization except accidents,

105
00:05:14,471 --> 00:05:16,951
 2-4 years for pre-existing diseases,

106
00:05:17,211 --> 00:05:20,591
 2 years for specific surgeries like hernia, joint replacement, cataract,

107
00:05:20,671 --> 00:05:23,191
 2-4 years for maternity and newborn coverage.

108
00:05:23,331 --> 00:05:27,651
 Now, these are non-negotiable, so start early and let the clock run.

109
00:05:27,711 --> 00:05:31,251
 Because when you really need the cover, you want zero waiting periods left.

110
00:05:31,251 --> 00:05:33,331
 But there's also a way to reduce waiting periods.

111
00:05:33,331 --> 00:05:34,851
 We will tell you how a little later.

112
00:05:34,851 --> 00:05:38,691
 Now let's talk premiums and why do they keep changing?

113
00:05:38,691 --> 00:05:42,931
 The reason is because you move into higher age bands.

114
00:05:42,931 --> 00:05:44,931
 Because medical inflation goes up.

115
00:05:44,931 --> 00:05:47,331
 Because insurers revise prices.

116
00:05:47,331 --> 00:05:49,331
 And yes, your city matters too.

117
00:05:49,331 --> 00:05:50,611
 India uses zonal pricing.

118
00:05:50,611 --> 00:05:53,491
 So Mumbai and Delhi pay more than smaller towns.

119
00:05:53,491 --> 00:05:55,811
 If you move cities, tell your insurer.

120
00:05:55,811 --> 00:05:57,731
 Otherwise, they might cut claims later.

121
00:05:57,731 --> 00:06:00,451
 Alright, now how much cover is enough?

122
00:06:00,451 --> 00:06:04,611
 For individual at least 10-15 lakh rupees if you're in a metro, for families a floater

123
00:06:04,611 --> 00:06:06,691
 plan with 15-25 lakh rupees.

124
00:06:06,691 --> 00:06:24,256
 If you want solid peace of mind add 50 lakh top up for a few hundred bucks extra Don under insure once you fall sick or claim once getting more cover later becomes really hard because now the insurer sees you as a high risk Alright how long should you take health insurance for Now plans come for 1 2 3 years Longer term ones often have higher

125
00:06:24,256 --> 00:06:29,356
 discounts. Whatever you choose, keep renewing on time. Even a one-day gap can reset all your

126
00:06:29,356 --> 00:06:34,376
 waiting periods and no claim bonuses. Okay, now let's talk about the claims experience.

127
00:06:34,376 --> 00:06:38,276
 For planned surgeries, inform your insurer 48-72 hours in advance.

128
00:06:38,376 --> 00:06:40,216
 Fill out a pre-auth form at the hospital.

129
00:06:40,576 --> 00:06:42,556
 If it's approved, you get cashless treatment.

130
00:06:42,696 --> 00:06:44,816
 For emergencies, inform within 24 hours.

131
00:06:44,956 --> 00:06:46,796
 If you're in a network hospital, cashless works.

132
00:06:47,156 --> 00:06:50,036
 If not, you pay first and claim reimbursement later.

133
00:06:50,176 --> 00:06:54,336
 Remember, keep all the bills, discharge summary, prescriptions, scans, doctor notes.

134
00:06:54,716 --> 00:06:57,036
 Because missing paper might equal missing money.

135
00:06:57,196 --> 00:06:59,276
 Claims get rejected too and here's why.

136
00:06:59,356 --> 00:07:02,996
 You either didn't disclose a pre-existing condition when buying the policy

137
00:07:02,996 --> 00:07:08,036
 or maybe you claimed during a waiting period or let's say you chose a hospital room above your

138
00:07:08,036 --> 00:07:13,876
 policy's limit or maybe you submitted in company documentation or you forgot to renew your policy

139
00:07:13,876 --> 00:07:19,076
 i know it sucks but most rejections happen due to lack of awareness not fraud i have some final

140
00:07:19,076 --> 00:07:24,836
 thoughts these are some mistakes to avoid don't hide your medical history please declare everything

141
00:07:24,836 --> 00:07:30,116
 don't buy the cheapest plan just to save 500 rupees also don't skip reading about sub limits

142
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:34,916
 and room rent limits. Don't rely only on your office plan. Don't forget to check the

143
00:07:34,916 --> 00:07:40,836
 insurers claim track record and most importantly don't wait for health care to buy insurance.

144
00:07:40,836 --> 00:07:45,796
 Folks are you still confused? That's okay. Health insurance is not something you learn in a single
