00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,600
 Hey Vsauce, Michael here and today we are going to talk about color.

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:07,200
 Green, green, green, green.

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,600
 Goldon, let me just pink this up. Yellow.

4
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:13,800
 Michael, aren't you going to come to the concert this evening?

5
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:16,400
 I read about that. There's going to be a lot of purple there.

6
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,600
 I didn't teal you about this earlier?

7
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:22,000
 Well look, I have to go brown town first, but I'll be white black.

8
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:24,200
 Colors.

9
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:30,520
 Did you know that the human eye can differentiate 10 million different colors?

10
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:35,620
 But what color is a mirror?

11
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:39,940
 You might say silver because mirrors are often illustrated that way.

12
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:45,240
 And to be sure, they are made out of silver or silvery things like aluminum.

13
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:49,340
 But a mirror in reality is whatever color you point it at.

14
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:52,180
 In this green room, the mirror is green.

15
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:56,440
 And if you look inside a mirror, it becomes you-colored.

16
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:59,580
 An object is whatever color it doesn't absorb.

17
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:04,560
 These sticky notes are orange, because when hit with typical white light, they absorb

18
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:22,722
 every other wavelength of visible light except for orange which they diffuse into your eyeballs But a perfect mirror reflects all colors equally So in a way you could say that a mirror is white Except a mirror doesn reflect colors in the same way that pigment does

19
00:01:23,182 --> 00:01:27,242
 A mirror reflects incoming light in a single outgoing direction.

20
00:01:28,322 --> 00:01:30,902
 Specular reflection, not diffuse.

21
00:01:31,222 --> 00:01:34,922
 This kind of reflection creates an image of the very thing in front of the mirror.

22
00:01:34,922 --> 00:01:40,422
 So as bad astronomy jokes, a mirror is more of a smart white.

23
00:01:40,422 --> 00:01:43,422
 But wait a second, that is a perfect mirror.

24
00:01:43,422 --> 00:01:46,922
 And we live in the real world where there are no perfect mirrors.

25
00:01:46,922 --> 00:01:50,422
 Every mirror absorbs a little bit of light.

26
00:01:50,422 --> 00:01:53,422
 Not enough that it matters, I mean, looks pretty clear to me.

27
00:01:53,422 --> 00:01:58,922
 But when you take a look at the spectrum of light reflected by a typical mirror,

28
00:01:58,922 --> 00:02:04,982
 you will find that it best reflects light within the 510 nanometer range,

29
00:02:04,982 --> 00:02:12,182
 which we perceive as green light. So technically a mirror is a tiny tiny tiny

30
00:02:12,182 --> 00:02:17,642
 bit green. You may have noticed this yourself when investigating a mirror

31
00:02:17,642 --> 00:02:22,622
 tunnel. This happens when two mirrors face each other. Reflecting the same

32
00:02:22,622 --> 00:02:37,265
 scene back and forth and back and forth and back and forth with each new reflection a little bit more visual light is lost but green least of all That why the reflection way down the tunnel is dimmer and greener

33
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:42,365
 So maybe real world mirrors aren't smart white, they're actually kind of green,

34
00:02:42,565 --> 00:02:45,005
 but we should talk about white.

35
00:02:45,745 --> 00:02:47,965
 En español, white es blanco.

36
00:02:48,605 --> 00:02:50,365
 En français, white se dit blanc.

37
00:02:51,005 --> 00:02:54,385
 And in English, we have a word that comes from the same root.

38
00:02:54,385 --> 00:03:02,125
 black, which is the opposite of white. How did that happen? Well, it turns out that all of those

39
00:03:02,125 --> 00:03:11,065
 words come from the same ancient Proto-Indo-European root word, black, which meant shine, burn, flash.

40
00:03:11,485 --> 00:03:17,685
 Some languages took it to mean the brightness of the flash, white, while others took it to mean

41
00:03:17,685 --> 00:03:21,685
 what's left behind, the burned black darkness.

42
00:03:21,685 --> 00:03:27,685
 If you have blue eyes, your eyes aren't actually blue in the sense that the molecules inside them

43
00:03:27,685 --> 00:03:31,685
 are absorbing all of their wavelengths of visible light and diffusing the blue.

44
00:03:31,685 --> 00:03:37,685
 No, no, no. Instead, your eyes are blue for the same reason that the sky is blue.

45
00:03:37,685 --> 00:03:39,685
 Interference.

46
00:03:39,685 --> 00:03:53,907
 In our sky light from the sun encounters molecules of air And because of the size of those molecules light of longer wavelengths can slip on by But shorter wavelengths crash into the particles like blue light and scatter

47
00:03:53,907 --> 00:03:58,407
 Which is why we see blue when we look at the sky away from the Sun.

48
00:03:58,407 --> 00:04:02,907
 Without the air molecules, that space would just be black.

49
00:04:02,907 --> 00:04:06,907
 And when direct sunlight has to travel through a lot of air,

50
00:04:06,907 --> 00:04:12,087
 Almost all the colors get scattered out except for the longest wavelengths, the red,

51
00:04:12,087 --> 00:04:15,587
 which is what gives a sunrise and a sunset their color.

52
00:04:15,587 --> 00:04:22,887
 The iris of your eyeball contains a hazy layer where light can be scattered just like the sky.

53
00:04:22,887 --> 00:04:28,527
 Through a similar but slightly different process, shorter wavelengths are scattered more,

54
00:04:28,527 --> 00:04:30,207
 making your eyes look blue.

55
00:04:30,207 --> 00:04:32,767
 Unless, of course, you have some melanin in that iris,

56
00:04:32,767 --> 00:04:36,847
 in which case your eyes are going to be green, hazel, or brown.

57
00:04:37,487 --> 00:04:41,247
 Enjoy those colors, and as always, thanks for watching.
