1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,880
 Bluetooth is literally indistinguishable from magic.

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:07,840
 Give an iPhone 7 and some AirPods to a Victorian child and watch them get burned at the stake

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,800
 just for holding that stuff. Like we're for real just here on a big rock with sticks and water and made Bluetooth from that.

4
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:16,600
 What the flip is going on here? Well, it's actually quite simple.

5
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:23,700
 No, it's not. That was a lie. This stuff is whack. To begin, your phone and earbuds communicate with light. Not this light,

6
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:28,040
 not this light either. It's like a freaky sort of light. On the electromagnetic spectrum,

7
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:30,660
 From the human eye can see 400 to 600 nanometers.

8
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:33,360
 Zoom out and you'll notice the human eye is actually blind.

9
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:38,960
 The light that Bluetooth uses is over here, specifically 121mm through 124mm.

10
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,940
 Not only is this light invisible to the human eye, but the waves are so long that it can

11
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:46,160
 pass through walls like how visible light passes through glass.

12
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,380
 Cool, but how does light allow me to listen to Shakira?

13
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:50,520
 Ones and zeros.

14
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:55,040
 Say 121mm is purple and 124mm is green.

15
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:57,980
 If your phone wants to send a 1 to your earbuds, your antenna turns purple.

16
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:01,460
 The antenna on the earbuds sees this and tells the microchip in the earbuds,

17
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:02,920
 Hey, it's purple.

18
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,380
 And then the microchip writes down a 1.

19
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:07,880
 If the phone wants to send a 0, the antenna turns green and the same thing happens.

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,940
 This happens about a million times a second.

21
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:14,060
 Okay, so now we know how to communicate, but this brings up about a million problems.

22
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:17,480
 For example, if my bro is next to me listening to L. Taylor Swift

23
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:20,200
 while I'm hearkening to the songs of Shakira like a real man,

24
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:23,580
 how does my earbuds know to ignore the Taylor Swift and only play Shakira?

25
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:25,440
 Well, this problem has a couple of solutions.

26
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:28,480
 First of all, it's not actually just purple and green.

27
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:32,860
 There are 79 separate sections or channels within the range of purple and green.

28
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:36,160
 Each channel has its own specific wavelength for 1 and 0.

29
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:40,380
 So while you might be in channel 37, your bro could be in channel 73.

30
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:45,660
 But what if there are 158 different phones and earbuds playing music in the same place?

31
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:46,660
 Two for each channel.

32
00:01:46,780 --> 00:02:00,563
 First of all the lag would be absolutely scandalous But still your earbuds would limp along playing the one and only Shakira and no one else garbage How Well this is when we finally talk about how your headphones and phone pair

33
00:02:00,803 --> 00:02:03,003
 Think of your earbuds as being a lock.

34
00:02:03,163 --> 00:02:07,503
 When you click the pair button on said earbuds, it actively sends out a key through its antenna.

35
00:02:07,823 --> 00:02:12,363
 Then, in your phone settings, you can see all the keys being sent out, and your phone can say,

36
00:02:12,463 --> 00:02:14,783
 Key number 37948, I choose you.

37
00:02:14,883 --> 00:02:19,563
 What then happens is at the beginning of each package of ones and zeros, your earbuds change its lock.

38
00:02:19,563 --> 00:02:22,103
 and using the old key, it gives a new key to your phone.

39
00:02:22,263 --> 00:02:25,903
 So, your earbuds technically can hear your bro's Taylor Swift playing,

40
00:02:26,263 --> 00:02:27,463
 if it's in the same channel,

41
00:02:27,583 --> 00:02:29,243
 but since it doesn't have the correct key,

42
00:02:29,383 --> 00:02:30,823
 it not only ignores it completely,

43
00:02:31,183 --> 00:02:33,103
 but it actually has no idea how to read it,

44
00:02:33,163 --> 00:02:35,763
 because the key is an encryption for the rest of the message.

45
00:02:35,943 --> 00:02:37,423
 Now, another question arises.

46
00:02:37,763 --> 00:02:40,283
 Couldn't someone just intercept and then decrypt

47
00:02:40,283 --> 00:02:42,923
 of all of what's being transmitted between your phone and headphones?

48
00:02:43,203 --> 00:02:46,143
 Well, some of the engineers probably watched a little Einstein's as a kid,

49
00:02:46,203 --> 00:02:48,443
 because there's a genius solution to this problem.

50
00:02:48,443 --> 00:02:51,083
 Your phone and earbuds don't just stay in one channel.

51
00:02:51,363 --> 00:02:53,203
 They do something called frequency hopping.

52
00:02:53,383 --> 00:02:57,943
 They hop around from channel to channel and do this about 1,600 times every second.

53
00:02:58,143 --> 00:03:01,623
 So an eavesdropper might be able to listen in for a teeny fraction of a second,

54
00:03:01,923 --> 00:03:06,343
 but then you change channels and they would have no way of knowing what channel you went to.

55
00:03:06,443 --> 00:03:10,363
 But then how does both your phone and earbuds know what channel to go to?

56
00:03:10,483 --> 00:03:12,723
 Well, when your phone initially connects and says,

57
00:03:12,723 --> 00:03:15,003
 key number 37948, I choose you,

58
00:03:15,003 --> 00:03:22,243
 Within that message, it picks out a sequence and sends that information encrypted over to your headphones before any sound is even playing.

59
00:03:22,363 --> 00:03:26,923
 This way, your phone and headphones are the only things that know what channel they're going to go to next.

60
00:03:27,043 --> 00:03:28,363
 So yeah, not too complicated.

61
00:03:28,603 --> 00:03:31,403
 Now you should be able to take sticks, rocks, and water and create some Bluetooth.

62
00:03:31,743 --> 00:03:32,203
 You're welcome.

63
00:03:32,343 --> 00:03:35,763
 That's going to cost you one subscribe and let me just flip this bad boy around.

64
00:03:35,983 --> 00:03:37,463
 Tips in the form of likes are appreciated.
